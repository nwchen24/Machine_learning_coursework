    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup postings on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish between the topics based on the text of the posts. Whereas with digit classification, the input is relatively dense: a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero, here we'll represent each document with a \"bag-of-words\" model. As you'll see, this makes the feature representation quite sparse -- only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The bag-of-words assumption here is that the label depends only on the words; their order is not important.\n",

    "The most surprising results are in the bi-gram feature table where many of the most important features appear quite generic suh as 'it was', 'and such, or 'with you'. It is surprising that such generic features can be the most important in identifying news articles for these categories. My intuition says that for a feature to be important in the model, it must appear across a large number of examples of a given category. When we use features that are composed of two words, it becomes less likely that a non-generic string of two words will appear in enough examples of a given target category to be deemed one of the most important features. By contrast, it should not surprise us that generic phrases appear in many examples of a given target class which is why they end up being the most important in defining that target class.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Interestingly, if we allow for features to be anywhere from one to three words long, all of the most important features end up being single words."

    "(5) Try to improve the logistic regression classifier by passing a custom preprocessor to CountVectorizer. The preprocessing function runs on the raw text, before it is split into words by the tokenizer. Your preprocessor should try to normalize the input in various ways to improve generalization. For example, try lowercasing everything, replacing sequences of numbers with a single token, removing various other non-letter characters, and shortening long words. If you're not already familiar with regular expressions for manipulating strings, see https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html, and re.sub() in particular.

In sum, Ezekiel prophesi that the place would be mash and never rebuilt; a there are a lot of\\npeople liv there, it would appear that Ezekiel wa not literal correct.\\n\\nThi doesn\\'t bother me at all, because I understand the language Ezekiel us different than do so-call Biblical literalist   For example, it sometime happen that someone say \"My grandson i the cutest baby!\" and then turn around and see the granddaughter and say \"Oh!  Isn\\'t she the cutest th ?\"\\n\\nThi person i not literal claim to have lin up all the babie in the\\nworld accord to cutene and discover hi own grandchildren ti for\\nfirst.  Rather, he i try to expre hi emotion u word that are very\\nobject-orient   Because thi example i one that i common to many people,\\nnobody misunderstand the intent of the statement  the Bible, however, i often at the mercy of people who assume that everyth within must be exact literal true.  For those people, the existence of Tyre i a problem; for me,\\nit i not.\\n\\n\\nTurn to the latest person try to defend Ezekiel, we read thi from\\nJohn E K \\n\\n\\nNo, it implie noth of the kind.  If you had noth but the prophecy from\\nEzekiel, and you were told you interpret it literal  you would never say\\n\"Oh, he mean that there will be house and businesse and plant and stuff\\nlike that.\"  You would read \"I will make you a bare rock\" and \"You will never\\nbe rebuilt\", and you\\'d conclude that Tyre would be a bare rock.  The on way\\nto get from `fish net  to `house and building and a medium-large\\npopulation\\' i if you KNOW that all that latter stuff i there.\\n\\nIn other word  your answer mean that Ezekiel misl everybody who read the\\nprophecy at the time it wa written.  There i no way that, given a literal\\nread  they could read thi passage and conclude \"medium-size city\".\\n\\nYou seem to feel that \"Never be rebuilt\" mean \"be rebuilt\" -- maybe so, but\\nit i hard a `clear implication\\'.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, no.  That\\' on a bit le than the population of Annapoli  where I\\'m\\nfrom.  You know, the Naval Acadamy, the state capital, George Washington\\nresign hi commission in the statehouse?  Annapoli may not be New York, but\\nit\\' at least a two-horse town.\\n\\nBut suppo 22,000 people i a \"small town\" -- it\\' still 22,000 people\\nMORE than Ezekiel predict \\n\\n\\nAnd you\\'ve said noth about the other problem.  In chapter 26, Ezekiel\\npredict that Nebuchadnezzar will will destroy Tyre and loot all their\\nvaluable   However, Nebuchadnezzar did NOT destroy Tyre, and in chapter 29\\nEzekiel even quote God a say \"he and hi army got no reward from the\\ncampaign he l against Tyre.\"\\n\\nLet\\' ignore Alexander for a moment, and just pay attention to chapter 26.\\nEzekiel say N. would destroy Tyre, and N. did NOT destroy Tyre.  Ezekiel say that N. would plunder their valuable  but N. did NOT plunder their valuable \\n\\nRegardle of what you think about Tyre _now_, the fact i that N. di before\\nthe place wa destroy   Ezekiel said N. wa go to do it, and N. did not.\\n\\n *\\n\\nThi post i  of course, pointle   Inerrantist have an amaz ability\\nto rewrite the Bible a need to fit whatever they want it to say.\\n\\nFor example, I expect Mr K to respond to the comment about Ezekiel 26\\nby pull some \"clear implication  out of hat.\\n\\nWhen Ezekiel said that N. would \"demolish your tower , that clear impli that the wall would still be stand so people would know where the tower us to be.  And when Ezekiel said that N. would \"demolish your fine house and throw your stone  timber and rubble into the sea\", that clear impli that N. would never set foot on the island.  And when Ezekiel wrote that N.\\nwould \"build a ramp up to your wall , that clear implie that N. would\\nspend 13 year stomp around on the mainland and never get close to the\\nwall \\n\\nSee?

Each spline ha an equal number of segment   We assume\\n\\tthat the nth segment along each spline i rough  but not\\n\\texact  the same distance along each spline by any reasonable\\n\\tmeasure.\\n2) Take each segment (n) along each spline and match it to the nth segment\\n\\tof the oppo spline.  Use the pair of segment to form two\\n\\ttriangle which will be fill in to color the surface.\\n3) Depth sort the triangle 4) Take each triangle in sort order, project onto a 2D pixmap, draw\\n\\tand color the triangle.  Take the edge of the triangle that i \\talong the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge\\n\\tcolor with a special \"edge color\"\\n\\n\\tIt i the edge color in step 4 that i at the heart of the\\nproblem.

Thi article attempt to provide a gentle introduction to\\nlogic, in the hope of improv the general level of debate.\\n\\nLogic i the science of reason  proof, think  or inference [Concise\\nO .  Logic allow u to analyze a piece of reason and determine whether\\nit i correct or not (valid or invalid).  Of course, one doe not ne to\\nstudy logic in order to reason correct  neverthele  a little basic\\nknowledge of logic i often helpful when construct or analyz an\\nargument.\\n\\nNote that no claim i be made here about whether logic i universal applicable.  The matter i very much open for debate.  Thi document mere explain how to use logic, given that you have already decid that logic i the right tool for the job.\\n\\nProposition (or statement  are the build block of a logical argument. A\\nproposition i a statement which i either true or false; for example, \"It i rain  or \"Today i Tuesday\".  Proposition may be either assert (said to\\nbe true) or deni (said to be false).  Note that thi i a technical mean of \"deny\", not the everyday mean \\n\\nThe proposition i the mean of the statement, not the particular\\narrangement of word us to expre it.  So \"God exist  and \"There exist a\\nGod\" both expre the same proposition.\\n\\nAn argument i  to quote the Monty Python sketch, \"a connect serie of\\nstatement to establish a definite proposition\".  An argument consist of\\nthree stage \\n\\nFirst of all, the proposition which are necessary for the argument to\\ncontinue are stat   These are call the premise of the argument.  They\\nare the evidence or reason for accept the argument and it conclusion  \\n\\nPremise (or assertion  are often indicat by phrase such a \"because\",\\n\"since\", \"obviou  and so on.  (The phrase \"obviou  i often view with\\nsuspicion, a it can be us to intimidate other into accept suspiciou premise   If someth doesn\\'t seem obviou to you, don\\'t be afraid to\\nquestion it.  You can alway say \"Oh, ye  you\\'re right, it i obviou  when\\nyou\\'ve heard the explanation.)\\n\\nNext, the premise are us to derive further proposition by a proce known\\na inference.  In inference, one proposition i arriv at on the basi of\\none or more other proposition already accept   There are variou form of\\nvalid inference.\\n\\nThe proposition arriv at by inference may then be us in further\\ninference.  Inference i often denot by phrase such a \"implie that\" or\\n\"therefore\".\\n\\nFinal  we arrive at the conclusion of the argument -- the proposition which\\ni affirm on the basi of the premise and inference.  Conclusion are often\\nindicat by phrase such a \"therefore\", \"it follow that\", \"we conclude\"\\nand so on.  The conclusion i often stat a the final stage of inference.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nEvery event ha a cause (premise)\\nThe universe ha a beginn (premise)\\nAll beginning involve an event (premise)\\nThi implie that the beginn of the universe involv an event (inference)\\nTherefore the universe ha a cause (inference and conclusion)\\n\\nNote that the conclusion of one argument might be a premise in another\\nargument.  A proposition can on be call a premise or a conclusion with\\nrespect to a particular argument; the term do not make sense in isolation.\\n\\nSometime an argument will not follow the order given above; for example,\\nthe conclusion might be stat first and the premise stat \\nafterward in support of the conclusion.  Thi i perfect valid, if \\nsometime a little confu \\n\\nRecogniz an argument i much harder than recogniz premise or\\nconclusion   Many people shower their writ with assertion without ever\\nproduc anyth which one might reasonab describe a an argument.  Some\\nstatement look like argument  but are not.  For example:\\n\\n\"If the Bible i accurate, Jesu must either have been insane, an evil liar,\\n or the Son of God.\"\\n\\nThi i not an argument, it i a conditional statement.  It doe not assert\\nthe premise which are necessary to support what appear to be it \\nconclusion.  (It also suffer from a number of other logical flaw  but we\\'ll\\ncome to those later.)\\n\\nAnother example:\\n\\n\"God creat you; therefore do your duty to God.\"\\n\\nThe phrase \"do your duty to God\" i not a proposition, since it i neither\\ntrue nor false.  Therefore it i not a conclusion, and the sentence i not an\\nargument.\\n\\nFinal  causality i important.  Consider a statement of the form \"A because\\nB\".  If we\\'re interest in establish A and B i offer a evidence, the\\nstatement i an argument.  If we\\'re try to establish the truth of B, then\\nit i not an argument, it i an explanation.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n\"There must be someth wrong with the engine of my car, because it will not\\n start.\" -- Thi i an argument.\\n\\n\"My car will not start because there i someth wrong with the engine.\"\\n -- Thi i an explanation.\\n\\nThere are two traditional type of argument, deductive and inductive.  A\\ndeductive argument i one which provide conclusive proof of it conclusion -- that i  an argument where if the premise are true, the conclusion must\\nalso be true.  A deductive argument i either valid or invalid.  A valid\\nargument i defin a one where if the premise are true, then the\\nconclusion i true.\\n\\nAn inductive argument i one where the premise provide some evidence for the\\ntruth of the conclusion.  Inductive argument are not valid or invalid;\\nhowever, we can talk about whether they are better or worse than other\\nargument  and about how probable their premise are.\\n\\nThere are form of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive\\nnor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive\\nargument  a they are often view a the most rigorou and convinc \\n\\nIt i important to note that the fact that a deductive argument i valid doe not imp that it conclusion hold   Thi i because of the slight \\ncounter-intuitive nature of implication, which we must now consider more\\ncareful \\n\\nObviou a valid argument can consist of true proposition   However, an\\nargument may be entire valid even if it contain on false proposition  \\nFor example:\\n\\n   All insect have wing (premise)\\n   Woodlice are insect (premise)\\n   Therefore woodlice have wing (conclusion)\\n\\nHere, the conclusion i not true because the argument\\' premise are false. \\nIf the argument\\' premise were true, however, the conclusion would be true. \\nThe argument i thu entire valid.\\n\\nMore subt  we can reach a true conclusion from one or more false premise \\na in:\\n\\n   All fish live in the sea (premise)\\n   Dolphin are fish (premise)\\n   Therefore dolphin live in the sea (conclusion)\\n\\nHowever, the one th we cannot do i reach a false conclusion through valid\\ninference from true premise   We can therefore draw up a \"truth table\" for\\nimplication.\\n\\nThe symbol \"=>\" denote implication; \"A\" i the premise, \"B\" the conclusion. \\n\"T\" and \"F\" represent true and false respective \\n\\nPremise Conclusion Inference\\n   A        B        A=>B\\n----------------------------\\n   F        F         T      If the premise are false and the inference\\n   F        T         T      valid, the conclusion can be true or false.\\n\\n   T        F         F      If the premise are true and the conclusion\\n                             false, the inference must be invalid.\\n\\n   T        T         T      If the premise are true and the inference valid,\\n                             the conclusion must be true.\\n\\nA sound argument i a valid argument whose premise are true.  A sound \\nargument therefore arrive at a true conclusion.  Be careful not to confuse\\nvalid argument with sound argument \\n\\nTo delve further into the structure of logical argument would require\\nlengthy discussion of linguistic and philosophy.  It i simpler and probab more useful to summarize the major pitfall to be avoid when construct an argument.  These pitfall are known a fallacie \\n\\nIn everyday English the term \"fallacy\" i us to refer to mistaken belief a well a to the faulty reason that lead to those belief   Thi i fair\\nenough, but in logic the term i general us to refer to a form of\\ntechnical incorrect argument, especial if the argument appear valid or\\nconvinc \\n\\nSo for the purpose of thi discussion, we define a fallacy a a logical\\nargument which appear to be correct, but which can be seen to be incorrect\\nwhen examin more close   By study fallacie we aim to avoid be misl by them.  The follow list of fallacie i not intend to be\\nexhaustive.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)\\n\\nThe Appeal to Force i committ when the arguer resort to force or the\\nthreat of force in order to try and push the acceptance of a conclusion.  It\\ni often us by politician  and can be summariz a \"might make right\". \\nThe force threaten ne not be a direct threat from the arguer.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"... Thu there i ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All those who\\nrefuse to accept that truth will burn in Hell.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM\\n\\nArgumentum ad hominem i literal \"argument direct at the man\".\\n\\nThe Abusive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occur when, instead of try to disprove the truth of an assertion, the arguer attack the person or\\npeople mak the assertion.  Thi i invalid because the truth of an\\nassertion doe not depend upon the goodne of those assert it.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"Atheism i an evil philosophy.  It i practis by Communist and murderer \"\\n\\nSometime in a court of law doubt i cast upon the testimony of a witne by \\nshow  for example, that he i a known perjurer.  Thi i a valid way of\\nreduc the credibility of the testimony given by the witne  and not\\nargumentum ad hominem; however, it doe not demonstrate that the witne  testimony i false.  To conclude otherwise i to fall victim of the\\nArgumentum ad Ignorantiam (see elsewhere in thi list).\\n\\nThe circumstantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem i committ when a person\\nargue that hi opponent ought to accept the truth of an assertion because of\\nthe opponent\\' particular circumstance \\n\\nFor example:\\n\"It i perfect acceptable to kill animal for food.  How can you argue\\notherwise when you\\'re quite happy to wear leather shoe \"\\n\\nThi i an abusive charge of inconsistency, us a an excuse for dismi the opponent\\' argument.\\n\\nThi fallacy can also be us a a mean of reject a conclusion.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"Of course you would argue that positive discrimination i a bad th  \\nYou\\'re white.\"\\n\\nThi particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one allege that one\\' adversary i rationaliz a conclusion form from selfish interest  i also known a \"poison the well\".\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM\\n\\nArgumentum ad ignorantium mean \"argument from ignorance\".  Thi fallacy\\noccur whenever it i argu that someth must be true simp because it\\nha not been prov false.  Or, equivalent  when it i argu that\\nsometh must be false because it ha not been prov true.  (Note that thi i not the same a assum that someth i false until it ha been prov true, a basic scientific principle.)\\n\\nExample \\n\"Of course the Bible i true.  Nobody can prove otherwise.\"\\n\\n\"Of course telepathy and other psychic phenomena do not exist.  Nobody ha shown any proof that they are real.\"\\n\\nNote that thi fallacy doe not app in a court of law, where one i general assum innocent until proven guilty.\\n\\nAlso, in scientific investigation if it i known that an event would produce\\ncertain evidence of it hav occurr  the absence of such evidence can \\nvalid be us to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:\\n\\n\"A flood a describ in the Bible would require an enormou volume of water\\nto be present on the earth.  The earth doe not have a tenth a much water,\\neven if we count that which i frozen into ice at the pole   Therefore no\\nsuch flood occurr \"\\n\\nIn science, we can valid assume from lack of evidence that someth ha not occurr   We cannot conclude with certainty that it ha not occurr \\nhowever.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM\\n\\nThi i the Appeal to Pity, also known a Special Plead   The fallacy i \\ncommitt when the arguer appeal to pity for the sake of gett a \\nconclusion accept   For example:\\n\\n\"I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Please don\\'t find me\\nguilty; I\\'m suffer enough through be an orphan.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM\\n\\nThi i known a Appeal to the Gallery, or Appeal to the People.  To\\ncommit thi fallacy i to attempt to win acceptance of an assertion by\\nappeal to a large group of people.  Thi form of fallacy i often\\ncharacteriz by emotive language.  For example:\\n\\n\"Pornography must be bann   It i violence against women.\"\\n\\n\"The Bible must be true.  Million of people know that it i   Are you try to tell them that they are all mistaken fool \"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM\\n\\nThi fallacy i close relat to the argumentum ad populum.  It consist of\\nassert that the more people who support or believe a proposition, the more\\nlike it i that that proposition i correct.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM\\n\\nThe Appeal to Authority use the admiration of the famou to try and win\\nsupport for an assertion.  For example:\\n\\n\"Isaac Newton wa a geniu and he believ in God.\"\\n\\nThi line of argument i not alway complete bogu  for example, reference\\nto an admitt authority in a particular field may be relevant to a\\ndiscussion of that subject.  For example, we can distinguish quite clear between:\\n\\n\"Stephen Hawk ha conclud that black hole give off radiation\"\\nand\\n\"John Searle ha conclud that it i impossible to build an intelligent\\n computer\"\\n\\nHawk i a physicist, and so we can reasonab expect hi opinion on black\\nhole radiation to be inform   Searle i a linguist, so it i questionable \\nwhether he i well-qualifi to speak on the subject of machine intelligence.\\n\\nTHE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT\\n\\nThe Fallacy of Accident i committ when a general rule i appli to a\\nparticular case whose \"accidental\" circumstance mean that the rule i inapplicable.  It i the error made when one goe from the general to the\\nspecific.  For example:\\n\\n\"Christian general dislike atheist   You are a Christian, so you must\\ndislike atheist \"\\n\\nThi fallacy i often committ by moralist and legalist who try to decide\\nevery moral and legal question by mechanical app general rule \\n\\nCONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION\\n\\nThi fallacy i the reverse of the fallacy of accident.  It occur when one\\nform a general rule by examin on a few specific case which are not\\nrepresentative of all possible case \\n\\nFor example:\\n\"Jim Bakker wa an insincere Christian.  Therefore all Christian are\\ninsincere.\"\\n\\nSWEEP GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER\\n\\nA sweep generalization occur when a general rule i appli to a\\nparticular situation in which the feature of that particular situation\\nrender the rule inapplicable.  A sweep generalization i the opposite of a\\nhasty generalization.\\n\\nNON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\\n\\nThese are known a False Cause fallacie \\n\\nThe fallacy of Non Causa Pro Causa occur when one identifie someth a the\\ncause of an event but it ha not actual been shown to be the cause.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"I took an aspirin and pray to God, and my headache disappear   So God\\ncur me of the headache.\"\\n\\nThe fallacy of Post Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occur when someth i assum to\\nbe the cause of an event mere because it happen before the event.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"The Soviet Union collaps after tak up atheism.  Therefore we must avoid\\natheism for the same reason \"\\n\\nCUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\\n\\nThi fallacy i similar to post hoc ergo propter hoc.  It assert that\\nbecause two event occur together, they must be causal relat  and leave no room for other factor that may be the cause(  of the event \\n\\nPETITIO PRINCIPII\\n\\nThi fallacy occur when the premise are at least a questionable a the\\nconclusion reach \\n\\nCIRCULU IN DEMONSTRANDO\\n\\nThi fallacy occur when one assume a a premise the conclusion which one\\nwishe to reach.  Often, the proposition will be rephras so that the\\nfallacy appear to be a valid argument.  For example:\\n\\n\"Homosexual must not be allow to hold government office.  Hence any\\ngovernment official who i reveal to be a homosexual will lose hi job. \\nTherefore homosexual will do anyth to hide their secret, and will be open\\nto blackmail.  Therefore homosexual cannot be allow to hold government\\noffice.\"\\n\\nNote that the argument i entire circular; the premise i the same a the \\nconclusion.  An argument like the above ha actual been cit a the reason\\nfor the British Secret Service  official ban on homosexual employee  \\nAnother example i the classic:\\n\\n\"We know that God exist because the Bible tell u so.  And we know that the\\nBible i true because it i the word of God.\"\\n\\nCOMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION\\n\\nThi i the Fallacy of Presupposition.  One example i the classic load \\nquestion:\\n\\n\"Have you stopp beat your wife?\"\\n\\nThe question presuppose a definite answer to another question which ha not\\neven been ask   Thi trick i often us by lawyer in cro examination,\\nwhen they ask question like:\\n\\n\"Where did you hide the money you stole?\"\\n\\nSimilar  politician often ask load question such a \\n\\n\"How long will thi EC interference in our affair be allow to continue?\"\\nor\\n\"Doe the Chancellor plan two more year of ruinou privatization?\"\\n\\nIGNORATIO ELENCHI\\n\\nThe fallacy of Irrelevant Conclusion consist of claim that an argument \\nsupport a particular conclusion when it i actual logical noth to do\\nwith that conclusion.\\n\\nFor example, a Christian may begin by say that he will argue that the\\nteaching of Christianity are undoubtab true.  If he then argue at length\\nthat Christianity i of great help to many people, no matter how well he\\nargue he will not have shown that Christian teaching are true.\\n\\nSad  such fallaciou argument are often successful because they arouse\\nemotion which cause other to view the suppos conclusion in a more\\nfavourable light.\\n\\nEQUIVOCATION\\n\\nEquivocation occur when a key word i us with two or more different\\nmeaning in the same argument.  For example:\\n\\n\"What could be more affordable than free software?  But to make sure that it\\nremain free, that user can do what they like with it, we must place a\\nlicense on it to make sure that will alway be free redistributable.\"\\n\\nAMPHIBO \\nAmphibo occur when the premise us in an argument are ambiguou because\\nof carele or ungrammatical phra \\n\\nACCENT\\n\\nAccent i another form of fallacy through shift mean   In thi case,\\nthe mean i chang by alter which part of a statement are\\nemphasiz   For example, consider:\\n\\n\"We should not speak ILL of our friend \\nand\\n\"We should not speak ill of our FRIEND \\n\\nFALLACIE OF COMPOSITION\\n\\nOne fallacy of composition i to conclude that a property shar by the part of someth must app to the whole.  For example:\\n\\n\"The bicycle i made entire of low ma component  and i therefore very \\nlightweight.\"\\n\\nThe other fallacy of composition i to conclude that a property of a number\\nof individual item i shar by a collection of those item   For example:\\n\\n\"A car use le petrol and cause le pollution than a bu   Therefore car are le environmental damag than buse \"\\n\\nFALLACY OF DIVISION\\n\\nThe fallacy of division i the opposite of the fallacy of composition.  Like\\nit opposite, it exist in two varietie   The first i to assume that a\\nproperty of some th must app to it part   For example:\\n\\n\"You are study at a rich college.  Therefore you must be rich.\"\\n\\nThe other i to assume that a property of a collection of item i shar by\\neach item.  For example:\\n\\n\"Ant can destroy a tree.  Therefore thi ant can destroy a tree.\"\\n\\nTHE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT\\n\\nThi argument state that should one event occur, so will other harmful\\nevent   There i no proof made that the harmful event are caus by the\\nfirst event.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin\\nand we\\'ll have a nation full of drug-addict on welfare.  Therefore we cannot\\nlegalize marijuana.\"\\n\\n\"A I BAS ON B\" FALLACIE / \"I A TYPE OF\" FALLACIE \\nThese fallacie occur when one attempt to argue that thing are in some way\\nsimilar without actual specify in what way they are similar.\\n\\nExample \\n\"Isn\\'t history bas upon faith?  If so, then isn\\'t the Bible also a form of\\nhistory?\"\\n\\n\"Islam i bas on faith, Christianity i bas on faith, so isn\\'t Islam a\\nform of Christianity?\"\\n\\n\"Cat are a form of animal bas on carbon chemistry, dog are a form of\\nanimal bas on carbon chemistry, so aren\\'t dog a form of cat?\"\\n\\nAFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT\\n\\nThi fallacy i an argument of the form \"A implie B, B i true, therefore A\\ni true\".  To understand why it i a fallacy, examine the truth table for\\nimplication given earlier.\\n\\nDENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT\\n\\nThi fallacy i an argument of the form \"A implie B, A i false, therefore B\\ni false\".  Again, the truth table for implication make it clear why thi i a fallacy.\\n\\nNote that thi fallacy i different from Non Causa Pro Causa; the latter ha the form \"A implie B, A i false, therefore B i false\", where A doe NOT in\\nfact imp B at all.  Here, the problem i not that the implication i invalid; rather it i that the falsene of A doe not allow u to deduce\\nanyth about B.\\n\\nCONVERT A CONDITIONAL\\n\\nThi fallacy i an argument of the form \"If A then B, therefore if B then A\".\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM\\n\\nThi i the fallacy of assert that someth i right or good simp because it i old, or because \"that\\' the way it\\' alway been.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM\\n\\nThi i the opposite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it i the fallacy of\\nassert that someth i more correct simp because it i new or newer\\nthan someth else.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM\\n\\nThe fallacy of believ that money i a criterion of correctne  that those\\nwith more money are more like to be right.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM\\n\\nThe fallacy of assum that because someone i poor he or she i sounder or\\nmore virtuou than one who i wealthier.  Thi fallacy i the opposite of the\\nargumentum ad crumenam.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM\\n\\nThi i the incorrect belief that an assertion i more like to be true the\\nmore often it i heard.  An \"argumentum ad nauseum\" i one that employ constant repetition in assert someth \\n\\nBIFURCATION\\n\\nAlso referr to a the \"black and white\" fallacy, bifurcation occur when\\none present a situation a hav on two alternative  where in fact other\\nalternative exist or can exist.\\n\\nPLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTION \\nThi fallacy occur when a questioner demand a simple answer to a complex\\nquestion.\\n\\nNON SEQUITUR\\n\\nA non-sequitur i an argument where the conclusion i drawn from premise which are not logical connect with it.\\n\\nR HERR \\nThi fallacy i committ when irrelevant material i introduc to the issue\\nbe discuss  so that everyone\\' attention i divert away from the\\npoint be made, toward a different conclusion.\\n\\nREIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION\\n\\nReification occur when an abstract concept i treat a a concrete th \\n\\nSHIFT THE BURDEN OF PROOF\\n\\nThe burden of proof i alway on the person mak an assertion or\\nproposition.  Shift the burden of proof, a special case of argumentum ad\\nignorantium, i the fallacy of putt the burden of proof on the person who\\ndenie or question the assertion be made.  The source of the fallacy i the assumption that someth i true unle proven otherwise.\\n\\nSTRAW MAN\\n\\nThe straw man fallacy i to misrepresent someone else\\' position so that it\\ncan be attack more easi  then to knock down that misrepresent position,\\nthen to conclude that the original position ha been demolish   It i a\\nfallacy because it fail to deal with the actual argument that have been\\nmade.\\n\\nTHE EXTEND ANALOGY\\n\\nThe fallacy of the Extend Analogy often occur when some suggest general\\nrule i be argu over.  The fallacy i to assume that mention two \\ndifferent situation  in an argument about a general rule, constitute a \\nclaim that those situation are analogou to each other.\\n\\nThi fallacy i best explain u a real example from a debate about \\nanti-cryptography legislation:\\n\\n\"I believe it i alway wrong to oppose the law by break it.\"\\n\\n\"Such a position i odiou  it implie that you would not have support  Martin Luther K \"\\n\\n\"Are you say that cryptography legislation i a important a the\\n struggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!\"\\n\\nTU QUOQUE\\n\\nThi i the famou \"you too\" fallacy.  It occur when an action i argu to\\nbe acceptable because the other party ha perform it.  For instance:\\n\\n\"You\\'re just be random abusive.\"\\n\"So?  You\\'ve been abusive too.\"', u'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDo you question the existence of Alexander the Great, Tilgrath Pilisar III,\\nNero, Caligula, Josephu  Cyru the Great, Artexerxe    Their document have decay to dust too.  Brian, why another excuse? \\n\\n\\nPeter wrote a bit of the Bible.  What Peter say about God i what\\nthe Bible say    \\n\\n\\nConsider the Bible a court record   Over the period of thousand of\\nyear  variou people come up and testify of their experience with the\\nliv God.  Up come Abraham the wealthy rancher.  Up come Mose \\nonce the high official of Egypt.  Up come Elijah, a priest.  Up come David, a mere shepherd who became K   Up come the pagan K \\nNebuchanezzar.  Up come the pagan K of Persia, Cyru   Up come Nehemiah, cupbearer to the K of Persia.  Then Matthew, an IR agent\\ntake the stand.  Up come Luke, an M.D.  Then Paul a Jew who use\\nto kill Christian for fun.  Up come John, a 17 year old boy.  Up\\ncome Peter, a fishermen.  Up come Jame  the brother of Jesu himself.\\nUp come hundr of other   You hear testimony from fishermen, IR agent  priest  King   The court hear last thousand of year with people com up and testify about the God who call himself\\n\"I am.\" \\n\\nWhile you are listen to all thi stuff, you realize that\\nK David could have never known John, Solomon could have never known\\nMatthew, Nehemiah could have never known Peter.  You realize that all these\\npeople are independent witnesse  and so, you rule out collaboration.  Yet\\nall of the witnesse tell of the same God.   Each testifier tell of hi own experience with the liv God.  Each experience i different, but each experience ha enough cro over to unmistaken reveal that each one of these people i talk about the very same God.\\nWhat Daniel did not know about God, the 3rd Highest Official of\\nBabylon, God reveal to John 600 year later--but with a different\\nperspective.

Er\\nstaat echter meer op stapel.\\n\\nStudenten natuur- en sterrenkunde kunnen op 26 april aan een\\nsterrenkundesymposium deelnemen. De onderwerpen van het\\nsymposium zijn opgebouwd rond een van de zwaartepunten van het\\nhuidige Utrechtse onderzoek: het onderzoek aan de zogeheten\\n'compacte objecten', de eindstadia in de evolutie van sterren.\\nBij de samenstell van het programma i getracht de\\ndeelnemer een zo aktueel en bre mogelijk beeld te geven van\\nde stand van zaken in het onderzoek aan deze eindstadia. In de\\neerste, inleidende lez zal dagvoorzitter prof.

(Ye  there are fossil that show sign of disease...\\nmost bone disorder  of course, but there are some.)

It\\nseem unlike that Satan, who' mak the disease  would also gift\\nhuman with the mean to fight them off. Simpler to make the disease le lethal, if he want survivor  A far a I can see, our immune system \\nimperfect though they may (present ) be, must have been built into u by God. I want to be clear on thi  are you say that God wa plann ahead for the time when Satan would be in charge by build an immune\\nsystem that wa not, at the time of design, necessary? That i  God made\\nour immune system ahead of time, know that Adam and Eve would sin and\\ntheir descendent would ne to fight off disease \\n\\n\\n Here' another puzzle. What, exact  do you mean by 'perfect' in the\\nphrase, 'creat .. perfect and without flaw'? To my mind, a 'perfect'\\nsystem would be incapable of degrad over time.

There\\nare many passage in the Bible that in their most straightforward\\nread show the Christian god behav in just thi way.\\nMichael cannot refer to \"base\" claim or base commandment to\\nshow that such reading are \"twist \" because thi divergence in\\nunderstand occur even in try to interpret the \"base\"\\nclaim and commandment   In addre conservative Christian \\nMichael will necessari draw upon secular and cultural notion that these conservative Christian will reject.  \\n\\n\\nBut these base commandment are too vague to serve a  \"a\\nprinciple for the CRITIQUE of ethical system \" The mean of\\nthese base commandment for any believer derive from the secular\\nand cultural notion that the believer bring to them, from how\\nthe believer mixe their demand with straightforward reading of\\nother Biblical passage  from a particular sectarian tradition,\\nor from some combination of these thing   These commandment lack sufficient substance in themself to serve a a basi for\\ncriticiz ethical system   What mean they have come from\\nthe ethical system the believer bring to these commandment  \\n\\n\\nJesu explicit state that thi summarize Jewish law, which\\nwould seem to br in all of it if we proper understand what\\nit mean to love God and love our neighbor   There are *many*\\nparable and teaching the gospel attribute to Jesu that are\\nstraightforward read a ethical commandment   The Pauline\\nepistle are similar full.  If it i not clear that these all\\ncome together in a sensible understand of ethical behavior,\\nthe problem i *not* a lack of raw material. \\n\\n-*----\\n\\nNo, Michael, the conservative Christian also take the gospel \\nseriou   What differentiate you i the way you interpret the\\ngospel.\\n\\n\\nIn a sense, the wide variety of interpretation doe tell u someth about Christianity.  It tell u that the New Testament\\nauthor left a sufficient vague hodge-podge that it can serve\\na the source text for many, vast different belief about the\\nnature of the Christian god and about what men should and\\nshouldn\\'t do. \\n\\nThe irony here i that there i *noth  in Christianity per\\nse that Michael can use to support the cause of lesbian and\\ngay   *Every* Christian principle he turn to thi cause i effective on through the extra-Christian principle through\\nwhich Michael interpret hi religion, and the homophobe app the *same* Christian principle  with equal justification, to\\ntheir cause.  In short, it i the extra-Christian principle that\\nmake Michael\\' Christianity beneficial, and I suspect they would\\nbe a beneficial, perhap moreso, without be filter by\\nChristian interpretation.  \\n\\nMichael paint a picture of \"standard American atheism\" a the\\nrejection of the evil in many conservative Christian\\ninterpretation of the Bible.  But I think it i even more\\ndamag to Christianity to note that the New Testament present such a vague hodge-podge of notion about the nature of God and\\nthe nature of the good (except, of course, when it i order by\\nan interpretation that relie on extraneou principle .

Well, I now have the\\nopportunity to write some font render software so I would like to have\\nsome of my question answer before I jump into the deep end.\\n\\nThe main problem I face i how to use the even/odd or non-wind rule to\\nturn the outline into a single outline polygon (my renderer can handle\\ncomplex polygon so there i no ne to reduce the polygon to simple\\npolygon . For example, in the letter \"O\" there are two outline \\n\\n\\t1) The outside outline which i clockwise (TrueType font)\\n\\t2) The inside outline which i counterclockwise.\\n\\nOne common solution us by a number of render package i to simp \\nconnect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the\\ntwo outline are closest. Thi i equivalent to descib a \"polygon with\\nhole . The renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior\\npolygon edge are in the opposite direction to the outside edge \\n\\nI do not want to use thi simplistic system since:\\n\\n\\t1) It will not handle all outline font proper (it i not a simple\\n\\t\\tmatter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for\\n\\t\\tsome fancy font .\\n\\t2) It doe not proper handle the even/odd or non-wind rule \\n\\nFrom my research over the year the proper solution i to use a trapezoid\\ndecomposition algorithm to scan convert the outline into trapezoid (a i done by the Postscript and TrueType font rasterizer . These trapezoidal\\npolygon can then be easi and proper render by the 3D scanline renderer.\\n\\nMy question i  are there any better solution to turn the outline into\\npolgyon other than the trapezoid decomposer? I am not fond of thi solution\\nsince it create exce number of polygon \\n\\nAnother question, for those in the know: what i the best algorithm to create\\nbevell and/or offset curve for font outline  I have a dozen paper on these\\nsubject but I can\\'t tell which method i the best to implement.\\n\\nThank for any pointer \\n\\n--> Rob Lansdale\\n', u'Jesu \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBlack and white.

The\\nissue that the Church had to face after Jesu  death wa what to do\\nabout Gentile who want to follow Christ.  The decision not to\\nimpose the Law on them didn\\'t say that the Law wa abolish   It\\nsimp acknowledg that fact that it didn\\'t app to Gentile   Thi i a simple answer, which I think just about everyone can agree to.\\n(A discussion of the issue in more or le these term i record in Act 15.)\\n\\nHowever there\\' more involv   In order to get a full picture of the\\nrole of the Law, we have to come to grip with Paul\\' apparent\\nrejection of the Law, and how that relate to Jesu  commendation of\\nthe Law.  At least a I read Paul, he say that the Law serve a\\npurpose that ha been in a certain sense superced   Again, thi issue isn\\'t one of the abolition of the Law.  In the middle of hi discussion, Paul note that he might be understood thi way, and\\nassure u that that\\' not what he intend to say.  Rather, he see the Law a primari be present to convict people of their\\nsinfulne   But ultimate it\\' an impossible standard, and one that\\nha been superced by Christ.  Paul\\' comment are not the world\\' clearest here, and not everyone agree with my read   But the\\ninterest th to notice i that even thi radical position doe not entail an abolition of the Law.  It still remain a an\\nuncompromi standard, from which not an iota or dot may be remov \\nFor it purpose of convict of sin, it\\' important that it not be\\nrelax   However for Christian  it\\' not the end -- ultimate we\\nlive in faith, not Law.\\n\\nWhile the theoretical categorie they use are rather different, in the\\nend I think Jesu and Paul come to a rather similar conclusion.  The\\nquot passage from Mat 5 should be taken in the context of the rest\\nof the Sermon on the Mount, where Jesu show u how he interpret the\\nLaw.  The \"not an iota or dot\" would suggest a rather literal read \\nbut in fact that\\' not Jesu  approach.  Jesu  interpretation emphasize the intent of the Law, and stay away from the ceremonial\\ndetail   Inde he i well known for tak a rather free attitude\\ntoward the Sabbath and kosher law   Some scholar claim that Mat\\n5:17-20 ne to be taken in the context of 1st Cent. Jewish\\ndiscussion   Jesu accuse hi opponent of car about giv a\\ntenth of even the most minor herb  but neglect the thing that\\nreal matter: justice, mercy and faith, and car about how cup and\\nplate are clean  but not about the fact that inside the people who\\nuse them are full of extortion and rapacity.  (Mat 23:23-25) Thi  and\\nthe discussion later in Mat 5, suggest that Jesu ha a very specific\\nview of the Law in mind, and that when he talk about maintain the\\nLaw in it full strength, he i think of these aspect of it.\\nPaul\\' conclusion i similar.  While he talk about the Law be superced  all of the specific example he give involve the\\n\"ceremonial law\", such a circumcision and the Sabbath.  He i quite\\nconcern about maintain moral standard \\n\\nThe net result of thi i that when Paul talk about the Law be superced  and Jesu talk about the Law be maintain  I believe\\nthey are talk about different aspect of the Law.  Paul i embroil in argument about circumcision.  A i natural in letter respond to specific situation  he\\' look at the aspect of the\\nLaw that i current cau trouble: the Law a specifical Jewish\\nceremonie   He certain doe not intend to abolish divine standard of conduct.

They look at the Station they are\\n   gett and the price they are pay and note that\\n   it doesn\\'t add up. They wonder thi blissful unaware\\n   that a third of the money i go for someth else.\"\\n\\nMy dear friend  your mix fact and fiction here. A couple\\nof week ago, when I first read thi in your post  I\\ntalk with one of the cost expert here in Space Station\\nat Headquarter [if you wonder why I didn\\'t post a\\nresponse immediate  I do have a real job I\\'m suppos to be do here at Headquarter  & digg up old 20 kHz\\ndata & look into Sherzer/Kyger claim rate pretty low\\non the totem pole of priority. Also, I spent last weekend\\nin Kansa City, at the National Science Teacher \\nAssociation conference, extoll the virtue of SSF\\nto 15,000 science teacher ]\\n\\nFirst off, ye  the concept of \\'center tax\\', or \\'wrap\\' doe exist. If I recall the number correct  the total \\'tax\\'\\nfor the SSF program for thi fiscal year i around $40 Million.\\nThi wa comput by add up the WP-1, WP-2, and WP-4\\ncenter \\'taxe . With the SSF budget for thi fiscal year at\\n$2.2 Billion, my calculater say the tax percentage i 04/2.2 = 1.8%\\n\\nOver the life of the SSF program, u your figure of $30\\nbillion for the cost of SSF, a tax at a 1.8% rate come to\\n$540 million. Thi i alot le than $10 billion, but I\\nwill concede it\\' still an appreciable amount of pocket\\nchange.\\n\\nI should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1/3 could\\nbe close to the actual rate. The tax i on charg on fund that are spent at the center (kind of like McDonald at some\\nstate  where you do have to pay sale tax if you eat\\nthe food at the restaurant, but you don\\'t if you get it\\ntake-out). For example, at WP-4, the vast bulk of the fund we receive go to the Rocketdyne Contract, and are *NOT*\\nsubject to the center tax (I don\\'t have the number in\\nfront of me, but I\\'d gue at least 95% of the WP-4 fund go to Rocketdyne). So, you could be right about a tax\\nrate of 1/3, but it\\' on appli to fund spent at the\\ncenter, and not to the prime contract \\n\\nThi lead to the obviou question \"What i the government\\ndo with SSF fund that don\\'t go to the prime contractor \\n(i.e. ok, WP-4 get a slice of the $30 billion pie. A\\nbig portion of thi slice goe to Rocketdyne. What happen to the balance of the fund  which aren\\'t eaten\\nup by the center tax?)\"\\n\\nAt WP-4, we call these fund we spend in-house support development fund (a they are support the development\\nwork done by Rocketdyne). We have us these fund to\\nsetup our own testb  to checkout the electrical\\npower system architecture. Our testb ha a real life\\nsolar array field (left over from solar cell research\\nresearch a few year back), with lead-acid car batterie (to simulate the Nickel-Hydrogen batterie on SSF), DC\\nswitchgear, DC-DC converter unit  and simulat load  Data from the testb wa us in a recent\\nchange evaluation involv concern about the stability\\nof the power system.\\n\\nWe have also us the support development money to\\npurchase Nickel Hydrogen batterie  which are on life\\ntest at both Lewi and the Crane Naval facility in\\nIndiana. A a side point, 6 of the battery cell on\\ntest recent hit the four year life test milestone.\\n38 cell have complet 18,552 to 23,405 cycle (the\\non-orbit batterie go through 5,840 cycle per year).\\n\\nA a final example, my \\'home\\' division at Lewi us the support development fund to purchase personal\\ncomputer and work station  for perform system\\nanalyse (like model of the performance of the\\nelectrical power system, availability calculation u a Monte-Carlo simulation, sett up a \\ndatabase with information on weight of the power\\nsystem element .\\n\\nFinal  the money rais by the \\'tax\\' doe not all\\ngo into a \\'slush fund.\\' At Lewi  the director\\ndoe control a small discretionary fund. Each year,\\nany individual at Lewi can submit a proposal to\\nthe director to get money from thi fund to look\\nat pretty much anyth within the Lewi Charter.\\n\\nMost of the tax, however, goe to fund the \\'general\\'\\nservice at the Center, like the library, the \\ncentral computer service division, the Contractor \\nwho remove the snow, etc. Thu  it i rather\\ndifficult to determine what percentage of the\\nSSF budget doesn\\'t go for SSF activitie  To get\\nan accurate figure, you would have to take\\nthe annual expenditure for the library (for example),\\nand then divide by the amount of the library fund us to support SSF (which would be hard to\\ncompute by itself - how would you figure out\\nwhat percentage of the bill for Aviation Week for\\n1 year i \\'billable\\' to SSF, would you base it on\\nthe person-hour SSF employee spend read AV-week\\nversu the rest of the center personnel). You would\\nthen have to compare thi estimate of the SSF\\nportion of the library expense with the portion of\\nthe tax that goe to support the library. Who know \\nmaybe SSF overpay on the tax to run the library, but\\nwe underpay for snow removal? Talk about\\na burecratic nightmare!', u\"  Bingo.\\n Noth evil at all.

I\\'m sure that appeasement would have\\nwork better than war, just like it did in WW2, eh?  I gue we\\nshouldn\\'t have fought WW2 either -- just think of all those innocent\\nGerman civilian kill in Dresden and Hamburg.  How about all the poor \\nFrench who di in the crossfire because we invad the continent?

The pretext for purg Roehm wa that he wa plann to use the SA in\\na coup against Hitler. Nowhere i there mention of u allegation of\\nhomosexuality a a pretext for the purge, nor a a justification afterward (it\\ni possible that the historie I\\'ve read have not mention thi  but I doubt\\nit - would it be in Hitler\\' best interest to admit to the world that hi former right hand man wa a homosexual?). \\n\\nAnyway, a I said before, it i alway possible that I have miss reference \\nto the Nazi mak use of charge of homosexuality against the SA after the \\nnight of the long knive - but thi doe not prove that they were false.

Since the accusation were made \\nby person outside of the Nazi party, long before it came to power, and those \\naccusation were common knowledge to journalist and other in Germany in the \\n1920\\' and 30\\'  just how would it be possible for the Nazi to go back in \\ntime and plant \"taint  evidence? How exact doe one doctor newspaper \\nwhich were circulat around the world, without the discrepancie be \\nobviou  What actual incidence of Nazi doctor evidence on thi matter\\ndo you know about? And what about the testimony of people who were involv in \\nthese matter  some of whom were not Nazi  And what i the point of mak a \\nfalse accusation of homosexuality if you do not publicize it? Since the point \\nhere seem to be to discredit establish history, then the burden of proof \\nfall on the revisionist. The revisionist had better do their homework \\nbefore mak accusation  Otherwise they simp look like conspiracy nut \\n\\n\\nThi i just about the *on  th we agree on. \\n\\nI suspect that the notion that there might have been bad people - Roehm and \\nhi SA buddie - who were homosexual must disturb some people. The feel seem to be that if a nasty individual i accus of homosexuality, that thi must be an attempt to bash homosexual  Thi fear - often justifi - i what\\nlie behind thi distrust of official history, or so it seem to me.

Mitchell\\n                          March 23, 1993\\n \\nINTRODUCTION:\\n \\nIn order to increase public interest in space-bas and lunar operation  a\\nreal miniature lunar-like environment i be construct on which to test\\ntele-operat model  These model are remote controll by individual locat world-wide u their personal computer  for EduTainment\\npurpose \\nNot on doe thi provide a test-b for simple tele-operation and\\ntele-presence activitie but it also provide for the shar of\\ninformation\\non method of operat in space, includ  but not limit to, layout of\\na\\nlunar colony, tele-operat machine for work and play, disseminat educational information, provid contest and award for creativity and\\nachievement and provide a new way for student worldwide to participate in\\nTwenty-First century remote learn method \\n \\nBecause of the nature of the LTM1 project, people of all age  interest and\\nskill can contribute scenery and mural  model and structure \\ninterfac and electronic  software and graphic  In operation LTM1 i an evolv playground and laboratory that can be us by children, student and\\nprofessional worldwide. U a personal computer at home or a terminal at\\na participat institution a user i able to tele-operate real model at\\nthe\\nLTM1 base for experimental or recreational purpose  Because a real\\nfacility\\nexist  ample opportunity i provid for media coverage of the\\nconstruction\\nof the lunar model, it operation and new feature to be add a suggest by the user themselve \\n \\nThi ha broad inherent interest for a wide range of group \\n - tele-operation and virtual reality research\\n - radio control, model railroad and ham radio operation\\n - astronomy and space planetarium and science center  - art and theater\\n - bb and online network user  - software and game developer  - manufacturer and retailer of model rocket  car and train  - children\\n - the child in all of u  \\nLTM1 OVERALL DESIGN:\\n \\nA room 14 feet by 8 feet contain the base lunar layout. The wall are us for mural of distant moon mountain  star field and a view of the earth.\\nThe \"floor\" i the simulat lunar surface. A global call for contribution i hereby made for material for the lunar surface, and for the design and\\ncreation of scale model of lunar colony element  scenery, and\\nmachine-let \\n \\n The LTM1 initial design ha 3 tele-operat machinelet \\n 1. An SSTO scale model which will be able to lift off, hover and land;\\n 2. A bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area; and\\n 3. A moon-train which will traverse most of the simulat lunar surface.\\n \\n Each machinelet ha a small TV camera utiliz a CCD TV chip mount on\\n it. A personal computer digitize the image (includ reduc picture\\n content and do data-compression to allow for minimal image to be sent\\n to the operator for control purpose  and also return control signal \\n \\nThe first machinelet to be set up will be the moon-train since model train with TV camera built in are almost off-the-shelf item and control\\nelectronic for start and stopp a train are minimal. The user will\\nreceive an image once every 1 to 4 second depend on the spe of their\\ndata link to LTM1.\\n \\nNext, an SSTO scale model with a CCD TV chip will be suspend from a\\nservo-motor operat wire frame mount on the ceil allow for the\\nSSTO\\nto be controll by the operator to take off, hover over the entire lunar\\nlandscape and land.\\n \\nFinal  some tank model will be modifi to be CCD TV chip equipp bulldozerlet  The entire initial LTM1 will allow remote operator worldwide\\nto receive minimal image while actual operat model for land and\\ntakeoff, travel and do work. The entire system i bas on\\ncommercial available item and part that can be easi obtain except for the\\ninterface electronic which i well within the capability of many advanc ham radio operator and computer hardware/software developer \\n \\nBy tak a graphical orient communication program (Dmodem) and add a tele-operation screen and control  the necessary user interface can be\\nprovid in under 80 man hour \\n \\nPLAN OF ACTION:\\n \\nThe Diaspar Virtual Reality Network ha agre to sponsor thi project by\\nprovid a host computer network and Internet acce to that network.\\nDiaspar i provid the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction\\nof the lunar model. Diaspar ha  in stock, the electronic tank that can be\\nmodifi and one CCD TV chip. Diaspar also agree to provide \"rail stock\"\\nfor the lunar train model. Diaspar will make available the Dmodem graphical\\ncommunication package and modify it for control of the machine let \\nAn initial \"ground break  with miniature shovel will be perform for\\na live photo-session and new conference on April 30, 1993. The initial\\nmodel will be put in place. A time-lapse record will be start for\\nhistorical purpose  It i not expect that thi event will be complete seriou or solemn. The lunar colony will be declar open for additional\\nbuild  operation and experiment  A photographer will be present and\\nthe photograph taken will be convert to .gif image for distribution\\nworld-wide to major online network and bb   A pre release will be\\nissu call for contribution of idea  time, talent, material and scale\\nmodel for the simulat lunar colony.\\n \\nA contest for new design and technique for work on the moon will then\\nbe\\nannounc  Universitie will be invit to participate, the goal be to\\nfind instructor who wish to have cla participation in variou aspect of\\nthe lunar colony model. Field trip to LTM1 can be arrang and at that\\ntime\\nthe result of the cla work will be add to the model. Contributor will\\nthen be able to tele-operate any contribut machine-let once they return\\nto\\ntheir campu \\n \\nA month LTM1 newsletter will be issu both electronical online and via\\nconventional mean to the media. Any major new tele-operat equipment\\naddition will be mark with an invitation to the television new media.\\nHav a large, real model space colony will be a very attractive photo\\nopportunity for the television community. Especial since the \"action\"\\nwill\\nbe controll by people all over the world. Science fiction writer will be\\ninvit to issue \"challenge  to engineer and human factor student at\\nuniversitie to build and operate the tele-operat equipment to perform\\nlunar task  U counter-weight and pulley system  1/6 gravity may be\\nsimulat to some extent to try variou traction challenge \\n \\nThe long term goal i creat world-wide interest, education,\\nexperimentation\\nand remote operation of a lunar colony. LTM1 ha the potential of be a\\nlong\\nterm global EduTainment method for space activitie and may be the generic\\nexample of how to teach and explore in many other subject area not limit to space EduTainment. All of thi facilitate the kind of spirit which can\\nlead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the star \\n \\nCONCLUSION:\\n \\nEduTainment i the blend of education and entertainment. Anyone who ha ever enjoy see miniature will probab see the potential impact of a\\nglobal available layout for recreation, education and experimentation\\npurpose  By creat a tele-operat model lunar colony we not on create\\nworld-wide publicity, but also a method of try new idea that require\\nreal\\n(not virtual) skill and open a new method for putt people\\' mind in\\nspace.\\n \\n \\nMOONLIGHTER \\n \\n\"Illuminat the path of knowledge about space and lunar development.\"\\nThe follow people are already engag in variou part of thi work:\\nDavid42, Rob47, Dash, Hyson, Jzer0, Vril, Wyatt, The Dark One, Tiggertoo,\\nThe Mad Hatter, Sir Robin, Jogden.\\n \\nCome join the discussion any Friday night from 10:30 to midnight PST in\\n \\nDiaspar Virtual Reality Network.

Patty Murray   We were there to discu SSTO, and\\ncommercial space.  Thi i how it went...\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter receiv a packet contain a presentation on the benifit of SSTO,\\nI call and tri to schedule a meet with our local Senator (D) Patty\\nMurray, Washington State.  I start ask for an hour, and when I heard\\nthe gasp on the end of the phone, I quick back off to 1/2 an hour.\\nLater in that conversation, I learn that a standard appointment i 15 minute \\n\\nWe got the standard bozo treatment.  That i  we were call back by an aide,\\nwho schedul a meet with u  in order to determine that we were not\\nbozo  and to familiarize himself with the material, and to screen it, to \\nmake sure that it wa appropriate to take the senator time with that material.\\n\\nWell, I got allocat 1/2 hour with Sen. Murray aide, and we end up talk to him for 45 minute  with u end the meet  and him still listen \\nWe cover a lot of ground, and on a little tiny bit wa DCX specific.  \\nMost of it wa a single stage reusable vehicle primer.  There wa another\\nwoman there who took copiu quantitie of note on EVERY topic that\\nwe brought up.\\n\\nBut, with Murray be new, we want to entrench ourselve a non-corporate\\nalign (I.E. not speak for boe  local citizen interentest in space.\\nSo, we spent a lot of time cover the benifit of lower cost acce to\\nLEO.  Solar power satellite are a big focu here, so we hit them a becom \\nfeasible with lower cost acce  and we hit the environmental stand on that.\\nWe hit the tourism angle, and I left a copy of the patric Collin Tourism\\npaper, with side note be that everyone who goe into space, and see the\\natmosphere become more of an environmentalist, esp. after SEE the smog\\nover L.A.  We hit on the benifit of study bone decalcification (which i \\nmore pronounc in space, and said that that had POTENTIAL to lead to \\nunderstand of, and MAYBE a cure for osteoporosi   We hit the education \\nwhereby kid get enthus by space, but a they get older and find out that\\nthey havent a hop in hell of actual gett there, they go on to other\\nfield  with low cost to orbit, the chance they might get there someday \\nwould provide greater incentive to hit the harder classe need \\n\\nWe hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle busine angle.  We hit the lower cost of satellite launche  gp navigation, personal\\ncommunicator  tellecommunication  new service  etc...  Job provid in those sector \\n\\nJob provid build the th  balance of trade improvement, etc..\\nWe mention that skypix would benifit from lower launch cost \\n\\nWe left the paper on what technologie need to be invest in in order\\nto make thi even easier to do.  And he ask question on thi point.\\n\\nWe end by tell her that we want her to be aware that effort are\\nproce in thi area, and that we want to make sure that the\\nresult from these effort are not lost (much like condor, or majellan),\\nand most important  we ask that she help fund further effort along\\nthe line of lower the cost to LEO.\\n\\nIn the middle we also gave a little speal about the Lunar Resource Data \\nPurchase act, and the guy fil it separate  he wa VERY interest in it.\\nHe ask some question about it, and seem like he want to jump on it,\\nand contact some of the people involv with it, so someth may actual happen immediat there.\\n\\nThe last two thing we did were to make sure that they knew that we\\nknew a lot of people in the space arena here in town, and that they\\ncould feel free to call u any time with question  and if we didn't know\\nthe answer  that we would see to it that they question got to people who\\nreal did know the answer \\n\\nThen final  we ask for an appointment with the senator herself.  He\\nsaid that we would get on the list, and he also said that know her, thi would be someth that she would be very interest in, although they\\ndo have a time problem gett her schedul  since she i on in the\\nstate 1 week out of 6 these day \\n\\nAll in all we felt like we did a pretty good job.\", u'\\nI am not aware of any \"Turkish Caliphate\" viewpoint on thi  Can you\\nreference?\\n\\nHowever, I found a quote due to Imam Ali, whom the Shia follow:\\n\\n\"Men, never obey your women in any way whatsoever.

Brian K., so far,\\non respond to the latter.  And I am glad he respond at all.   In both\\ncase of approach,  my intention i to be lov   I am mak no excuse\\nfor myself if I am com acro condesend   I apologize for that.\\n\\nRob, sometime Brian K. come acro a honest. I know thi   But Brian K. \\nvasillate back and forth.  One post look honest; the next i an excuse.  Now he want me to explain the universe in 50 word or le   \\nI think Brian Kendig i real try but he i too comfortable with\\nhi set of excuse   \\n\\nI just want Brian K. to be honest with himself.  If he real want to know, he will ask question and stop assert irrelevant excuse which have noth to do with my God.   I wish Brian would read the\\nBible for himself and come to hi own decision without be sidetrack with the temptation to mock God.\\n\\nFrom my perspective Rob, when I look at Brian Kendig, I see a man\\nstand out in the middle of a highway.  Off into the distance I \\nsee a Mack truck head right for him, but Brian K. i fac away\\nfrom the oncom truck.  He doesn\\'t see it.   Here\\' i how I see\\nthe dialog:\\n\\n\\nMe:  \"Brian K, please step aside before you get run over.\" \\n\\nBK:  \"There i no truck.\"\\n\\nMe:  \"Turn around at look.\"\\n\\nBK:  \"No.\"\\n\\nMe:  \"Look!  You will be healthier if you do take a look at\\n     the oncom truck.\"\\n\\nBK:  \"No. Explain to me why truck exist.\"\\n\\nMe:  \"Turn around or you will run over.\"\\n\\nBK:  \"No. I won\\'t because I like hik and tomorrow i Tuesday.\"\\n\\nMe:  \"You blind fool!  Why do you choose ignorance? You have noth       to lose if you look.  But if do not look, you will certain lose your life.\"\\n      I do not want to see you squash all over the road.\\n\\nBK:  \"It i my life to lose.

Because million if not\\nbillion of people fall into the same category.  Perhap all people\\nfall have fallen into thi category at one time in their live   I have.\\nI can now see the truck behind Brian.\\n\\nMy hope i that Brian will look and will see the ramification of the\\ntruck com toward him.  My hope i that Brian will want to step out\\nof the way.  My fear, though,  i that Brian will instead choose to glue himself\\nto the middle of the highway, where he will certain get run over.  But if\\nhe so choose  he so choose  and there i noth I can do beyond that\\nto change hi mind.   For it i hi choice.   But at thi very moment,\\nBrian hasn\\'t gotten even that far.  He i still at the point where he\\ndoe not want to look.  Sure he move hi eyeball to appease me, but hi head will not turn around to see the entire picture.

The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\\n the Future (Saoshyant) wa the basi for the story of the com of the Magi\\n to Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12).]\\n\\n  The Old Persian word magu, render in Greek by mago  i of uncertain \\netymology. It may original have meant \"member of the tribe,\" a in the\\nAvestan compound mogu-tbish (\"hostile to a member of the tribe\"). Thi mean would have been further restict  among the Mede  to \"member of the priest tribe\" and perhap to \"priest\" (Benveniste, 1938; Boyce, 1982). The term i probab of Median origin, given that Herodotu mention the \"Magoi\" a one of\\nthe six tribe of the Mede \\n  For a variety of reason we can consider the Magi to have been member of a\\npriest tribe of Median origin in western Iran. Among the Persian  they were\\nresponsible for liturgical function  a well a for maintain their\\nknowledge of the ho and the occult. Most like  the supremacy of the Median\\npriesthood in western Iran became establish dur the time of the Median\\nmonarchy that dominat the Persian from the end of the eighth century\\nthrough the first half of the sixth century BCE until the revolt of Cyru the\\nGreat (550 BCE). The Persian were indebt to the Mede for their political\\nand civil institution a well. Even if hypothese have been advanc concern the existence of Magi of Persian origin in the Achaemenid period\\n(Boyce, 1982), we must still maintain that they were of Median origin. Thi i demonstrat by the eposide of the revolt of Gaumata the Magian, mention by\\nDariu I (522-486 BCE) in the inscription at Bisutun (Iran), a well a by\\nGreek source  Inde  Herodotu insist on the idea of the usurpatory power of\\nthe Mede against the Persian through the conspiracy of the Magi.\\n  The fact that the Magi may have been member of a tribe that hand down the\\nsacerdotal art in a hereditary fashion natural did not exclude the\\npossibility that some of them undertook secular prefession  Thi seem to be\\nattest by the Elamite tablet at Persepoli \\n  There i a these  put forth by Giuseppe Messina, that denie that the Magi\\nare member of an ethnic group by suggest that they are simp member of\\nthe priesthood - a priesthood of pure Zoroastrian origin. Thi thesi i untenable; on the other hand, the hypothesi that their name i relat to the\\nAvestan term magavan, deriv from the Gathic maga (Vedic, magha, \"gift\"), i not without foundation (Mole, 1963). The mean of maga can probab be found,\\nin conformity with the Pahlavi tradition, within the context of the concept of\\npurity, or separation of the \"mixture\" of the two oppos principle of spirit\\nand matter. The maga, which ha been erroneou interpret a \"choru \" from\\nthe root mangh, which i said to mean \" the magic song\" (Nyberg, 1966) and\\nha been render simp by an expression like unio mystica, seem to be an\\necstatic condition that open the mind to spiritual vision. In any case, though\\nthere may be a relation between the Old Persian term magu and the Avestan term magavan and maga, we must maintain a clear distinction between the Magi and the\\nAvestan priesthood. The Avesta ignore the Median or Old Persian term, despite\\na recent hypothesi propos by H.W. Bailey; Old Persian inscription ignore\\nthe Avestan term for \"priest,\" athravan (Vedic, athravan), even if thi i \\nperhap present in an Achaeminid sett in the Elamite tablet of Persepoli \\n(Gershevitch, 1964).\\n  The term magu ha been present in Zoroastrianism throughout it history; the\\nPahlavi term mogh-mard and mobad represent it continuation. The latter in\\nparticular derive from an older form, magupati (\"head of the Magi\"). Dur the Sasanid period (third to seventh centurie CE), which saw the formation of\\na hierarchical organiz church, the title mobadan mobad (\"the high priest of\\nhigh priest ) came to be us to designate the summit of the ecclesiastical\\nhierarchy.\\n  The Magi practic consanguineou marriage, or khvaetvadatha (Av.; Pahl.,\\nkhwedodah). They also perform a characteristic funeral rite: the exposure of\\nthe corpse to animal and vulture to remove the flesh and thereby cleanse it.\\nThe corpse wa not suppos to decompose, lest it be contaminat by the demon of putrefaction. Thi practice later became typical of the entire Zoroastrian\\ncommunity and l to the rise of a complex funeral ritual in Iran and among the\\nParsi in India. Stone tower  known a dakhma  were built especial for thi rite. Dur the time of Herodotu the practice of exposure of the corpse wa in vogue on among the Magi; the Persian general sprinkl the corpse with\\nwax, then buri it. The practice wa widespread, however, among the people of Central Asia.\\n  The Magi were the technician of and expert on worship: it wa impossible to\\noffer sacrifice without the presence of a Magu  Dur the performance of a\\nritual sacrifice, the Magu sang of the theogony (the Magi were possib the\\ncustodian of a tradition of sacr poetry, but we know noth about the\\nrelationship of thi tradition to the variou part of the Avesta) and wa call upon to interpret dream and to divine the future. The Magi were also\\nknown for the practice of kill harmful, or \"Ahrimanical,\" animal (khrafstra)\\nsuch a snake and ant  They dress in the Median style, wear pant \\ntunic  and coat with sleeve  They wore a characteristic head cover of\\nfelt (Gr. tiara) with strip on the side that could be us to cover the nose\\nand mouth dur ritual to avoid contaminat consecrat object with their\\nbreath (Boyce, 1982). The color of these cap  in conformity with a tradition\\nthat i probab of Indo-European origin, accord to George Dumezil, wa that of the priesthood: white.\\n  In all likelihood, dur the Achaemenid period the Magi were not in\\npossession of a well-defin body of doctrine, and it i probable that they\\ngradual adopt Zoroastrianism; they were most like a clergy consist of\\nprofessional priest who were not ti to a rigid orthodoxy but were natural inclin to eclecticism and syncretism. Nonethele  they must have been\\njealou guardian of the patrimony of Zorastrian tradition  By virtue of thi they were the educator of the royal prince  The wisest of them wa responsible\\nfor teach the prince the \"magic of Zarathushtra, son of Horomaze  and thu the \"cult of the god \" Magi who excell in other virtue were entrust with\\nthe education of the prince so that he would learn to be just, courageou  and\\nmaster of himself.\\n  Dur the Achaemenid period the Magi maintain a position of great\\ninfluence, although they were certain subordinate to the emperor. Despite\\nseveral dramatic event such a the massacre they suffer after the death of\\nGaumata the Magian - in which, accord to Herodotu (who call himself\\nSmerdi , the Persian kill a large number of Magi to avenge the usurpation -\\nthe Magi neverthele manag to maintain their influence at court in Media,\\nin Persia, and in the variou region of the empire where they were station a a consequence of the Persian civilian and military administration.\\n  No priesthood of antiquity wa more famou than that of the Magi. They were\\nrenown a follower of Zarathushtra (Zoroaster); a the teacher of some of\\nthe greatest Greek thinker (Pythagora  Democritu  Plato); a the wise men\\nwho arriv  guid by a star, at the manger of the newborn savior in\\nBethlehem; and a the propagator of a cult of the sun in India. But they were\\nalso known a the Chaldean  the priesthood of Babylon, known for it occultism;\\nthi wa perhap the reason that the term mago had a pejorative sense in Greek,\\nlike \"goe \" \"expert in the magic art  (Bidez and Cumont, 1938). Inde  the\\nChaldean were expert in all type of magical art  especial astrology, and\\nhad a reputation for wisdom a well a knowledge.\\n  To understand the reason for such variou and sometime discordant view  it\\ni necessary to distinguish between the Magi of Iran proper and the so-call western Magi, who were later helleniz  In the Achaemenid period both must\\nhave been at least in part Zoroastrian, but the western Magi (those of the\\nIranian diaspora in Asia Minor, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia), who came in\\ncontact with diverse religiou tradition  must have, sooner or later and in\\nvary degree  been influenc by syncretic concept \\n  The Greek were familiar with both kind of Magi and, depend on their\\nvary concern  would emphasize one or the other aspect of them. Classical\\nhistorian and geographer  includ Herodotu and Strabo, document their\\ncustom  while the philosopher dwell above all on their doctrine  dualism,\\nbelief in the hereafter, Magian cosmology and cosmogony, and their theology\\nand eschatology. Those source most interest in the doctrine of the Magi\\neven speak of Zarathushtra a a Magu  In do so they are repeat what the\\nMagi themselve said from the Median and Achaemenid period  when they adopt Zoroastrianism. At that time they embrac Zarathushtra a one of their own and\\nplac themselve under hi venerable name.\\n  Zoroastrianism had already undergone several profound transformation in the\\neastern community by the time of the Acheamenid and wa already adapt those\\nelement of the archaic religion that refus to die. It ha been said quite\\noften, in an attempt to characterize the precise role of the Magi in the\\nZoroastrian tradition, that the Vendidad (from vi-daevo-data, \"the law-abjur daiva ), part of the Avesta, should be attribut to them. (Thi collection of\\ntext from variou period i primari concern with purificatory rule and\\npractice ) Nonethele  the hypothesi i hard plausible, since the first\\nchapter of the Vendidad - a list of sixteen land creat by Ahura Mazda, the\\nsupreme god of Zoroastrianism, but contaminat by an attack by Ahriman (Pahl.;\\nGathic-Avestan, Angra Mainyu), the other supreme god and the ultimate source of\\nall evil and suffer - doe not mention western Iran, Persia, or Media (the\\nland of Ragha mention in the text cannot be Median Raghiana). Furthermore, it\\nha been not (Gershevitch, 1964) that if the author had been Magi the\\nabsence of any reference to western Iranian institution  includ their own\\npriesthood, would be very strange.\\n  The Magi were above all the mean by which the Zoroastrian tradition and the\\ncorpu of the Avesta have been transmitt to u  from the second half of the\\nfirst millennium BCE on. Thi ha been their principal merit. We can attribute\\ndirect to the Magi the new formulation that Iranian dualism assum  known to\\nu especial from Greek source and, in part, from the Pahlavi literature of\\nthe ninth and tenth centurie CE. Accord to thi formulation, the two pole of the dualism are no longer, a in the Gatha  Spenta Mainyu (\"beneficent\\nspirit\") and Angra Mainyu (\"hostile spirit\") but Ahura Mazda himself and Angra\\nMainyu (Gershevitch, 1964). [See Ahura Mazda and Angra Mainyu.] Thi tran \\nformation wa of immense consequence for the historical development of Zoro-\\nastrianism and wa most like determin by the contact of the Magi with the\\nMesopotamian religiou world. In thi new dualism - which wa that later known\\nto the Greek (Aristotle, Eudemu of Rhode  Theopompu  and other  - we can\\nsee the affirmation of a new current of thought within Zoroastrianism, to which\\nwe give the name Zurvanism. [See Zurvanism.]\\n  Thank to their adherence to Zoroastrianism, the Magi play an enormou important role in the transmission of Zarathushtra\\' treaching  a well a in\\nthe definition of the new form that these would assume historical  Their\\nnatural propensity to eclecticism and syncretism also help the diffusion of\\nZoroastrian idea in the communitie of the Iranian diaspora. The Greek began\\nto study their doctrine and to take an interest in them (Xanthu of Lydia,\\nHermodoru  Aristotle, Theopompu  Hermippu  Dinon), even writ treatise on the Persian religion, of which on the title and a few fragment have\\nsurviv  In the Hellenistic period, the Magi were seen a a secular school of\\nwisdom, and writing on magic, astrology, and alchemy were lent the authority\\nof such prestigiou name a Zarathushtra, Ostane  and Hystaspe  form an\\nabundant apocryphal literature. (Bidez and Cumont, 1938).\\n  Later still, eschatology and apocalyptic were a fertile meet ground for Iranian and Judeo-Christian religion  a can be seen in the famou _Oracle of Hystaspes_, a work whose Iranian root are undeniable and which\\nmost like date from the beginn of the Christian era, probab the\\nsecond century CE (Widengren, 1968). The Zoroastrian doctrine of the Savior of\\nthe Future (Saoshyant) wa the basi for the story of the com of the Magi\\nto Bethlehem in the _Gospel of Matthew_ (2:1-12). [See Saoshyant.]\\n  The Sasanid period saw the Magi once again play a determin role in the\\nreligiou history of Iran. Concern to win back the western Magi (de Menasce,\\n1956), and eager to consolidate Zoroastrianism a the national religion of\\nIran, the priest of Iranian sanctuarie in Media and Persia were able to\\nestablish a true state church, strong hierarchical and endow with an\\northodoxy bas on the formation of a canon of scripture  The lead figure in the development of a state religion and of Zoroastrian orthodoxy were Tosar\\nand Kerder, the persecutor of Mani in the third century.', '', u'I ne a much information about Cosmo 2238 and it rocket fragment (1993-\\n018B) a possible.

In the Old Testament, we have\\nboth principle and specific rule   By the time of Jesu  most of the\\nprinciple were obscur by the emphasi men had plac on the rule \\nVolume of additional rule had been made to try to codify the\\napplication of the principle   We [mankind] weren\\'t comfortable with\\nthe \"subjectivity\" of principle  \\n\\n\\tFor reference see Matthew 5 where Jesu explain the difference\\n\\tbetween the Law and the principle of the Law.  For example, in\\n\\tverse 21-22:  \"You have heard that the ancient were told,\\n\\t\\'You shall not commit murder\\'...and \\'Whoever commit murder shall\\n\\tbe liable to the court.\\'  But I say to you that everyone who i \\tangry with hi brother shall be liable to the court...\"\\n\\nThe \"objective morality\" of God get blurr by our inept\\ninterpretation of it.

D1).  I thought I\\'d post it to\\nstir up some flame war - I mean reason debate.  Let me preface it by\\nsay that I large agree that the \"Space Age\" in the romantic sense\\nof several decade ago i over, and that project like the space station\\nmi the point at thi time.  Read  for example, \"What\\' New\" -\\nthe week physic update we get here on the net - it\\' clear that the\\nromance of the day lie in the ever more fine-grain manipulation of\\nmatter: by which I include biotechnology, condens matter physic (with\\nit spinoff in computer hardware and elsewhere), and the amaz thing people are do with individual atom these day   To a large extent, I\\nthink, the romance some people still have with space i a matter of\\nnostalgia.  I feel sure that someday we - or more precise  our \"mind\\nchildren\" - will spread acro space (unle we wipe ourselve out); but\\nI think that *mann  space exploration i not what i excit about\\nwhat we can do *now*.   \\n\\nAnyway, let me quote some of thi article, but not all...\\n\\n\\nSPACE AGE GLORY FADE FROM VIEW\\n\\nMicheal Schrage (writer, consultant, and research associate at MIT)\\n\\nAt 35, America\\' Space Age won\\'t have to suffer through the angst of a\\nmidlife crisi \\n\\nThe reason i that the Space Age i already dead.  The technologie no\\nlonger define our time  and the public ha grown weary of the multibillion\\n-dollar celestial investment that yield minimal psychic or economic\\nreward   \\n\\nSpace exploration ha mutat from a central focuse of America\\' science\\nand technology debate into a peripheral issue.  Speace i not a\\nmeaningful part of the ongo industrial competitivene debate, our\\ntechnology infrastructure discussion or even our defense conversion\\npolicy.  \\n\\nTo be sure, America should continue to invest in satellite technologie for telecommunication and remote sen - cheap deep-space probe would be nice too - but the ideal of space a a meaningful driver of\\nscientific and industrial innovation i now dead.\\n\\n.....\\n\\nBefore the change in administration  it would have been foolish to\\nwrite an obituary for the Space Age.  The Bush White House aggressive support the space program and propos spend well over $30 billion\\nto build space station Freedom alone.\\n\\nEven a he propos budget cut in other science and technology domain \\nOffice of Management and Budget Director Richard Darman wa an outspoken\\npublic champion of big-ticket space expenditure   The reality that much\\nof the civilian space program - from the shuttle to the Hubble telescope\\nto the space station - wa poor conceiv and unimpressive implement did not seem to matter much.\\n\\nPolitical inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism - not a coherent\\nvision or cost-effective sensibilitie - determin multibillion-dollar\\nspace budget \\n\\nInde  with few notable exception  such a Voyager, the post-Apollo\\nera i the story of the gold-plat porkification of space exploration\\nwith program and promise that deliver le for more and more.  \\n\\n......\\n\\nWhile the Clinton Administration ha kept on the high regard Daniel\\nGoldin a administrator of the National Aeronautic and Space\\nAdministration, it seem clear that space exploration i not be position a either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of America\\' technological prowe   The space station budget ha - right - been\\nslash   Space i virtual ignor when the Administration champion it competitivene agenda.\\n\\n......', u'...\\n\\n\\tBefore or after hi kid were shot?\\n\\n\\n\\tThen why make the comment?\\n\\n\\n\\tA did the Jew against the Nazi in WW II:  do what I say or die.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tALl human  I hope.\\n\\n\\n\\tOr perhap they have:  kill first, blame the dead one \\n\\tdestroy all the evidence.\\n', u\"\\nWow!

Please go back to my quot word above:\\n\\nThe \"possibility that alway exist  i that I (or, to revert to proper\\ntime sequence, my predecessor over the last several centurie  could\\npersuade \"Christian B\" of my case that the Inquisition *doe  inde constitute an egregiou violation of the Law of Love.

The elimination of Inqisitorial\\npractice (in those place where it *ha  been eliminat  or at least\\ngreat reduc  ha very little, if anyth  to do with the discussion\\nof sin in the exchange between A and B.\\n\\nMr. Turpin i point out that, if I am A versu the Grand Inquisitor\\' B,\\nthen my persuasion i not very like to work.  I know thi  and in what-\\never personal agony, I consign the issue to God and my ghost defense\\nattorney.  So, \"one possibility\" fail in thi case -- a it will fail in\\nmay other   At the other extreme, the \"persuasion\" will succe when it\\nproper SHOULD not, if it entail mistaken assumption I share with the\\nInquisitor.  And that i potential an even more troubl case, in that\\nmany of the victim of Inquisition will have \"accept  that they were in\\nfact sinful (in such random case a they may actual have been guilty\\nof charge brought against them.)\\n\\nThe point i that the \"persuasion\" break down when the partie do NOT\\nshare enough to agree on all the cultural baggage -- and given the main\\nthrust of the Inquisition, against \"heresy\", it i *bound* to break down\\nin precise the \"worst\" case   The \"conservative\" (I don\\'t think that\\ni the right word, BTW) will take refuge in what I attribute to B above,\\nthat he i \"justifi  in cau harm because he *think  that work to\\na \"greater good.\"  But thi i a violent and extravagant REFUSAL to follow\\nthe gospel, a if one\\' theorie about \"sin\" entitl one to cast aside\\nJesu  word on deal with sinner (cf.

Since Tonga ha a GNP of about $70 million,\\nHi Majesty ask if there wa any way to make money off thi   Matt thought\\nthere probab wa  so at hi suggestion, Tonga appli for 31 geosynchronou satellite slot   While thi isn\\'t entire off the wall, it wa very unusual,\\nsee a Tonga wa a tiny kingdom with no space program, and 31 i a lot of\\nslot \\n\\nThe whole th wa debat in the appropriate regulatory agency and Carl\\nHilliard (who i apparent a respect space lawyer) wrote several opinion support Tonga\\' case.  Eventual Tonga end up with 7 slot  rang from \\n70 E to 170 E (slot are designat by the longitude over which they reside).\\nAccord to Sternberg, four of these, from 130 E to 142 E are the best in the\\nworld because they are excellent plac for communication between Hawaii and \\nthe Pacific Rim. \\n\\nRIMSAT wa form to use these slot  It wa official form in Nevi a a tax\\nhaven.  They tri for a few year to raise fund in the west, however, to\\nfill 7 slot with western satellite launch on western launcher would have\\ncost approximate $2 billion.  It\\' not easy to raise that kind of money.\\nEventual  they hit upon the idea of u Russian hardware.  They began \\nnegotiat with Glavkosmo for hardware.  Mr Sternberg describe operat in \\nMoscow in such harsh term that I don\\'t think I\\'ll visit there for a long time.\\nBeside a significant lack of creature comfort  he wa not happy with the way\\nthat people operate.  For example \"everybody can sell you everyth \"  \\nEveryone can show the proper document and license that indicate they are the\\non one who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by.\\n\\nEventual  RIMSAT arrang a deal with Glavkosmo for 6 satellite at a cost\\nof $150 million.  However, Glavkosmo lost favor after the coup.  Sternberg\\nsay that thi i because they were basical a bunch of KGB operative who \\nwent to trade show and pick up lot of brochure   Since Glavkosmo wa out of power, he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authoritie   He\\nagain describ life in a Moscow hotel in rather unfavorable term   Eventual \\nhe work out a deal and on Dec 4, 1992 he met with Koptev, who head the \\nRussian space program, to sign the deal.  Koptev insist on a few concession before sign and accord to Sternberg he arrang these new rule to \\nallow himself to form another company to do the exact same th a RIMSAT.\\n\\nThe next step wa to meet with the builder of the hardware, NPO Appli \\nMechanic -- NPO PM to use their acronym.  Thi organization i locat in \\nSiberia (can\\'t figure out how to spell the town, I ne an atla  and ha built\\nabout 1500 vehicle since the dawn of the space age.  Sternberg comment that\\nsiberian are very different from Musovite   They are hard worker  honest\\npeople who team up to get thing done, very much like midwesterner   At thi point there were some comment from the audience that agre with hi opinion on\\nboth siberian and midwesterner :-)\\n\\nSternberg had lot of good thing to say about NPO PM.  Hi company i \\napparent lookng for $100 million to invest in the firm to become 50% partner It apparent cost the Russian about $4 million to build a satellite that\\nwould sell for $50 million in the west.  If you want to give them \\nspecification  they\\'ll build you a satellite.  For the particular satellite that RIMSAT will be u  cost run about $378,000 per transponder year.  Thi compare to $810,000 t/y in the U.   They can sell their time for about $1.1\\nmillion compar to $2.6 million in the U.   RIMSAT will launch their \\nsatellite on Proton   To get the best price  they bought in bulk.  They \\nhave the right to twelve launche  so if any of you ne a lift I can give\\nyou their addre   The first launch i schedul for October and they are\\ngett one us satellite from the Russian  which i be mov into place\\nnow.\\n\\nTidbit \\n\\n*  Sternberg say thi kind of th ha to be done by entrepreneur  not big\\nbusine because big busine i just like what they have over there, except\\nthat \"we have better paper, both in the bathroom and in the copier.\"\\n\\n*  Russian launche are self insur   The promise to replace a fail launch\\nwithin 9 month \\n\\n*  Major investor in RIMSAT include Russell 20/20, which i a huge retirement\\nfund organization, Cellsat, which i a big telecom busine in southeast Asia,\\nand a fund operat by some of the big name in U. aerospace which he say i sort of an insurance policy for them if thi real take off.\\n\\n*  He downplay the instabilite in the ex-USSR say that we are worri part because we aren\\'t us to see Russia a anyth but an unvary monolith.  Ita get a new government \"every two week  but we don\\'t worry \\nbecause we\\'re us to it.  He predict that once we get us to see what\\nreal goe on in Russia we won\\'t worry about their stability a much.\\n\\n*  Part of the problem with cooperative venture i the problem of transfer money.  The central bank ha a policy of tak hard currency payment  putt 25% in their coffer and replac the rest with the \"equivalent\" value in \\nruble   To get around thi  RIMSAT pay their hard currency into an Austrian\\nbank account.  NPO PM then pay their contractor with foreign currency so that\\nthe on the contractor get swindl by the government.\\n\\n*  One of the big problem RIMSAT ha had i stonewall by the western \\nsatellite industry.  However, Intelsat recent bought three of the same type\\nof satellite  which wa rather reassur \\n\\n*  The biggest worry most people have about russian satellite i the primitive\\ntechnology and shorter lifetime.  The older Gorizont (Horizon) satellite have\\na lifetime of about 5 year  while the more modern Expre satellite compare\\nwell with western technology and last about 8 year   While thi i much \\nshorter than 15 year for western satellite  Sternberg downplay the \\ndifference.  At these price they can afford to launch new one   In addition,\\nshorter lifetime mean that they can replace their equipment with newer\\ntechnology so they will be able to compete better than older, out of date\\nhardware.\\n', u\"\\nThi i an interest notion -- and one I'm scar of.

I just repost a\\nvery good one, under the title \"Islam and Women\", repost from\\nsoc.religion.islam.  If thi ha already disappear from your site,\\nthen please email me tell me so and I will email you a copy of thi excellent article.  \\n\\nIMHO, your understand of the issue of women in Islam i sad deficient.\\n\\nRegard slave  _my_ post on slavery -- the second one I made,\\nwhich i a repost of an article I wrote ear last year -- i bas complete on the Qur\\'an and contain numerou Qur\\'anic verse and\\nhadith to support it point of view.\\n\\nOur approache are different -- you are argu from a historical\\nstandpoint and I am argu direct from the teaching of the Qur\\'an\\nand hadith   Now, just because people say they are Muslim and perform\\na particular action, doe that automatical mean that their action i part of Islam, even if it i oppos by the Qur\\'an and Sunnah?  No!  Of\\ncourse not.\\n\\nLet me give you a concrete example, which might help clarify thi for\\nyou.  The Qur\\'an prohibit drink   Now, if a person say \"I am a\\nMuslim\" and then proce to drink a bottle of beer, doe thi now mean\\nthat Islam teache that people should drink beer?  Of course not, and\\non an idiot would think so.\\n\\nDo you see my point?\\n\\n\\nYou are judg Islam here on capitalist term   Capitalism i an\\nideology bas large on the assumption that people want to maximise\\ntheir wealth -- thi assumption i in opposition to Islamic teaching \\nTo say Islam i bad because it i not capitalist i pretty unthink --\\nIslam doe not pretend to be capitalist and doe not try to be\\ncapitalist.  (Thi doe not mean that Islam doe not support a\\nfree-market -- for it doe in general -- but there are other part of \\ncapitalism which are oppos to Islam a I understand it.)\\n\\n\\nOne can postulate numerou reason for thi   Your theory i that it i because Islam i not secularist and capitalist, etc. etc.\\n\\nSelim, I will give you a clear historical example to show you the\\nfallacy of your view if you think (a you obviou do) that\\nIslam => lack of education and power.\\n\\nFor a large part of history, the Islamic world wa very powerful.  For a\\nsignificant section of history, the Islamic world wa the foremost in\\nthe science   So to say that Islam i  for example, anti-education i complete absurd.  You try to blame thi situation on Islam -- history\\nshow that your conclusion i false and that, instead, there must be\\nother reason for thi situation.\\n\\n\\nWell, Selim, your viewpoint on women in Islam make me question the extent\\nof your knowledge of Islam.  I real think you are not\\nknowledgeable enough to be able to judge whether the Muslim are\\nfollow the Qur\\'an or not.\\n\\n\\nThe Islamic world wa at the forefront of the world in science at one\\nstage -- yet somehow, in your theory, it i by \"follow the Qur\\'an\"\\nthat Muslim are backward in education.  Selim, it i _your_ thesi that i anti-historical, for you convenient overlook thi historical\\nfact which contradict your theory. \\n\\n\\nYou have certain not shown thi  you have mere stat it.\\nSo far, it seem to me that your view on Islam be anti-education i quite contrary to history.  That you are so convinc of your view make me wonder just how objective you are try to look at all of\\nthi \\n\\n\\nI think, Selim, you should consider tak your own advice.\\n\\n\\nHere too.\\n\\n\\nSelim, you have such conviction of your viewpoint, yet you demonstrate\\nignorance, not on of Islam but also of Islamic history (particular with respect to Muslim be leader of science till about 1400 or so I\\nthink).  Yet you say that your viewpoint i bas on history!\\n\\nSelim, if I remember right, you say in one of your earlier post that\\nyou are an apostate from Islam.  I think you should slow down and start\\nthink clear about the issue  and start _reading_ some of our\\nposting about Islam rather than ignor them a you so obviou have.', u'On sunsite.unc.edu in pub/multimedia/utilitie unix find \\n mpeg_play-2.0.tar.Z.\\n\\nI find for mono it work best a mpeg_play -dither threshold \\n   though you can use            mpeg_play -dither mono\\n\\nFace it, thi i not be the best view situation.\\n\\nAlso someone ha made a patch for mpeg_play that give two more mono\\nmode  (mono2 and halftone).\\n\\nThey are by jan@pandonia.canberra.edu.au (Jan Newmarch).\\nAnd the patch can be found on csc.canberra.edu.au (137.92.1.1) under\\n/pub/motif/mpeg2.0.mono.patch.\\n', u'I am do a political science paper on the fund of NASA and pork-barrel \\npolitic   I would be interest in information about fund practice and\\nhistorie of some of the major program (Apollo, ST  SSF, etc) and the\\nfund of SSTO to contrast.

What about \\nhomosexual writer who agree with the official history? Don\\'t you think they \\nwould have found out the truth by now if Roehm and Heine were not homosexual \\nI would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from Nazism. No one \\nshould use any connection between the two to bash homosexual in any case. \\n\\n\\nIf you are go to challenge *all* historian on thi point (not just Irv ,\\nthen the burden of proof i on you.

What i your agenda here? To prove that the Nazi were heterosexual  so\\nthat you can bash heterosexual  Doe it bother you that some of the Nazi might have been homosexual  Doe thi make all homosexual bad if thi i true? Of course not. And what about bisexual  Are they half-Nazi \\n\\nI don\\'t know why it would be so difficult to believe that some Nazi were\\nhomosexual  The German officer corp before WW1, for instance, wa notoriou for it homosexuality. There were numerou scandal which rock the German\\ngovt. dur the late 19th and ear 20th century. Many of the Kaiser\\' friend were prosecut - the Kaiser wa no homosexual, but the Germany army had a long\\ntradition of tolerat homosexuality, go far back into Prussian history -\\nback to Frederick the Great at least, who wa himself a homosexual. Roehm wa a \\nproduct of thi Prussian officer tradition, and the old German army (like the\\nEnglish public school system), be a well known center of homosexuality,\\nwould have been quite will to overlook Roehm\\' homosexuality.\\n\\nIn addition, some Nazi complain of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth. The\\nHitler Youth swallow up all pre-Nazi youth group  and some of the variou \\npre-war Vandervogel, Bund, and Volkish youth group were known to promote \\nhomoerotic ideal and friendship, and in many case  homosexuality itself. So \\nit seem to me not unlike that there were plenty of homosexual Nazi  \\nregardle of the official Nazi dogma concern the \"evil  of homosexuality.\\nWhy should thi suprise anyone? Homosexuality ha alway exist  in all \\nsocietie - it would be most unusual if the Nazi were an exception.\\n\\nNo, I don\\'t have any source for you, a I think the on kind of proof you\\nwill accept would be citation from archival material, and I do not have acce \\nto these.

I have seen it describ  and\\nthe algiorithm seem a  little bit long.

It use few calculation however, basical it i several\\ncomparison   The on disadvantage I see i that it must be done after the\\ntransformation from view coordinate to coordinate to display on the\\nscreen, which mean that a little more calculation isneed beforehand.

To start with, line and\\npolygon are semi-algebraic set which both contain uncountable number of\\npoint   Here are a few off-the-cuff idea \\n\\nFirst, we ne to check if the line and the polygon are separat   Now, the\\nJordan curve separation theorem say that the polygon divide the plane into\\nexact two open (and thu non-compact) region   Thu  the line lie complete inside the polygon, the line lie complete outside the polygon,\\nor possib (but thi will rare happen) the line intersect the polyon.\\n\\nNow, the phra of thi question say \"if a line intersect a polygon\", so\\nthi i a decision problem.  One possibility (the decision model approach) i to reduce the question to some other (well known) problem Q, and then try to\\nsolve Q.  An answer to Q give an answer to the original decision problem.\\n\\nIn recent year  many geometric problem have been successful model in a\\nnew language call PostScript.  (See \"PostScript Language\", by Adobe System Incorporat  ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).\\n\\nSo, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a PostScript program that\\ndraw the line L and the polygon P, and then \"output  the answer.  By\\n\"output\", we mean the program execute a command call \"showpage\", which\\nactual print a page of paper contain the line and the polygon.  A quick\\nexamination of the paper provide an answer to the reduc problem Q, and thu the original problem.\\n\\nThere are two small problem with thi approach. \\n\\n\\t(1) There i an infinite number of way to encode L and P into the\\n\\treduc problem Q.  So, we will be forc to invoke the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice (or equivalent  Zorn\\' Lemma).  But the use of the Axiom of\\n\\tChoice i not regard in a very seriou light these day \\n\\n\\t(2) More important  the question arise a to whether or not the\\n\\tPostScript program Q will actual output a piece of paper; or in\\n\\tother word  will it halt?\\n\\n\\tNow, PostScript i expressive enough to encode everyth that a\\n\\tTur Machine might do; thu the halt problem (for PostScript) i \\tundecidable.  It i quite possible that the original problem will turn\\n\\tout to be undecidable.\\n\\n\\nI won\\'t even begin to go into other difficultie  such a alia  finite\\nprecision and runn out of ink, paper or both.\\n\\nA couple of reference might be:\\n\\n1.

If you have preference a to what\\nthe image are to be nam  include those a well.  \\n \\nConverse  if you have a scanner and would like to help out, please\\ncontact me and we\\'ll arrange thing \\n\\nIf you want to submit your work by disk, peachy.  Mere send a 3.5\"\\ndisk to the above addre (Omaha) and a SASE if you want your disk back.\\nThi i good for people who don\\'t have direct acce to encoder or FTP,\\nbut do have acce to a scanner.  We accept disk in either Mac or IBM\\ncompatible format.  If possible, please submit image file a GIF or\\nJPG.  If you can\\'t...we can convert from most format ..we\\'d just rather\\nnot have to.\\n\\nAt sender request, we can also fill disk with a much OTI a they\\ncan stand.  Even if you don\\'t have stuff to contribute, you can send\\na blank disk and an SASE (or $2.50 for disk, postage and pack  to \\nget a slab-o-OTI \\n\\nA of 04/21/93, we\\'re at about 18 megabyte of file  and grow   \\nEmail me for current archive size and directory.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nDISTRIBUTION?\\n\\nThe image distribut by the OTI project may be distribut free   \\non the condition that the original filename i kept and that it i not alter in any way (save to convert from one image format to\\nanother).  In fact, we encourage file to be distribut to local \\nbulletin board and such.  If you could, please transport the\\nappropriate text file along with the image   \\n \\nIt would also be nice if you\\'d send me a note when you did post image from OTI to your local bb   I just want to keep track of them so\\nparticipant can have some idea how widespread their stuff i \\n\\nIt\\' the purpose of OTI to get these image spread out a much a possible.  If you have the time, please upload a few to your favorite\\nBB system....or even just post thi \"info-file\" there.  It would be\\nkeen of you.\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nUSE?\\n\\nIf you want to use any of the work you find on the OTI directory,\\nyou\\'ll have to check to see if permission ha been grant and the \\nstipulation of the permission (such a free copy of publication, or\\nfull addre credit).  You will either find thi in the \".rm\" file for    \\nthe image or serie of image ..or in the \"Artist  directory under the \\nArtist name.

But two of those dimension can NOT be measur \\n          from our material half of the physical universe.  The one \\n          dimension that we CAN measure i the CLOCK time.  At low \\n          relative spe  the value of the other two dimension are \\n          NEGLIGIBLE; but at high spe  they become significant, and \\n          the Lorentz Transformation must be us a a FUDGE FACTOR. \\n          [Larson often us the term \"COORDINATE TIME\" when writ \\n          about thi ] \\n    \\n     \\n               In regard to \"ma increase , it ha been PROVEN in \\n          atomic accelerator that acceleration drop toward zero near \\n          the spe of light.

They are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of Larson\\' \\n          comprehensive Theory.

But the new Gamma Ray Telescope now in \\n          Earth orbit ha been detect them in all direction \\n          uniform  and their source location in space do NOT \\n          correspond to any known object  (except for a few case of \\n          directional coincidence). \\n    \\n               Gamma-ray burst are a NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE of the \\n          GENERAL UNIFI Theory of the physical universe develop by \\n          the late Physicist Dewey B.

Accord to page 386 of \\n          hi book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\", publish in 1984, the \\n          gamma-ray burst are com from SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION in the \\n          ANTI-MATTER HALF of the physical universe, which Larson call \\n          the \"Cosmic Sector\".  Because of the relationship between the \\n          anti-matter and material halve of the physical universe, and \\n          the way they are connect together, the gamma-ray burst can \\n          pop into our material half anywhere in space, seeming at \\n          random.  (Thi i WHY the source location of the burst do \\n          not correspond with known object  and come from all \\n          direction uniform ) \\n    \\n               I wonder how close to u in space a source location \\n          would have to be for a gamma-ray burst to kill all or most \\n          life on Earth!  There would be NO WAY to predict one, NOR to \\n          stop it! \\n    \\n               Perhap some of the MA EXTINCTION of the past, which \\n          are now be blam on impact of comet and asteroid  were \\n          actual caus by nearby GAMMA-RAY BURST  \\n    \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Binary Star Formation\\n          \\n               About half of all the star in the galaxy in the \\n          vicinity of the sun are binary or double.  But orthodox \\n          astronomer and astrophysicist still have no satisfactory \\n          theory about how they form or why there are so many of them. \\n    \\n               But binary star system are actual a LIKE \\n          CONSEQUENCE of the comprehensive GENERAL UNIFI Theory of \\n          the physical universe develop by the late Physicist Dewey \\n          B. Larson. \\n    \\n               I will try to summarize Larson explanation, which i \\n          detail in Chapter 7 of hi book \"THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION\" \\n          and in some of hi other book  \\n    \\n               First of all, accord to Larson, star do NOT generate \\n          energy by \"fusion\".  A small fraction come from slow \\n          gravitational collapse.  The rest result from the COMPLETE \\n          ANNIHILATION of HEAVY element (heavier than IRON).  Each \\n          element ha a DESTRUCTIVE TEMPERATURE LIMIT.  The heavier the \\n          element i  the lower i thi limit.  A star\\' internal \\n          temperature increase a it grow in ma via accretion and \\n          absorption of the decay product of cosmic ray  gradual \\n          reach the destructive temperature limit of lighter and \\n          lighter element  \\n    \\n               When the internal temperature of the star reache the \\n          destructive temperature limit of IRON, there i a Type I \\n          SUPERNOVA EXPLOSION!  Thi i because there i SO MUCH iron \\n          present; and that i relat to the structure of iron atom \\n          and the atom build proce  which Larson explain in some \\n          of hi book [better than I can]. \\n    \\n               When the star explode  the lighter material on the \\n          outer portion of the star i blown outward in space at le \\n          than the spe of light.  The heavier material in the center \\n          portion of the star wa already bounc around at close to \\n          the spe of light, because of the high temperature.  The \\n          explosion pushe that material OVER the spe of light, and \\n          it expand OUTWARD IN TIME, which i equivalent to INWARD IN \\n          SPACE, and it often actual DISAPPEAR for a while. \\n    \\n               Over long period of time, both masse start to fall \\n          back gravitational   The material that had been blown \\n          outward in space now start to form a R GIANT star.  The \\n          material that had been blown OUTWARD IN TIME start to form a \\n          WHITE DWARF star.  BOTH star then start mov back toward \\n          the \"MAIN SEQUENCE\" from opposite direction on the H-R \\n          Diagram. \\n    \\n               The chance of the two masse fall back into the \\n          exact same location in space, mak a single lone star \\n          again, are near zero.  They will instead form a BINARY \\n          system, orbit each other. \\n     \\n               Accord to Larson, a white dwarf star ha an INVERSE \\n          DENSITY GRADIENT (i densest at it SURFACE), because the \\n          material at it center i most wide dispers (blown \\n          outward) in time.   Thi ELIMINATE the ne to resort to \\n          MATHEMATICAL FANTASIE about \"degenerate matter\", \"neutron \\n          star , \"black hole , etc.. \\n    \\n\\n\\n          LARSONIAN Solar System Formation\\n\\n               If the ma of the heavy material at the center of the \\n          explod star i relative SMALL, then, instead of a single \\n          white dwarf star, there will be SEVERAL \"mini\" white dwarf \\n          star (revolv around the r giant star, but probab \\n          still too far away in three-dimensional TIME to be affect \\n          by it heat, etc.).  These will become PLANET  \\n      \\n               In Chapter 7 of THE UNIVERSE OF MOTION, Larson us all \\n          thi information, and other principle of hi comprehensive \\n          GENERAL UNIFI Theory of the physical universe, to derive \\n          hi own version of Bode\\' Law. \\n          \\n\\n\\n          \"Black Hole\" FANTASY!\\n\\n               I heard that physicist Stephen W.

First, in February, the Russian deploy a\\n20-m reflector from a Progre vehicle after it had depart from\\nthe Mir Space Station.  While thi \"Banner\" reflector wa blank,\\nNPO Energia wa very active in report that future  Banner\\nreflector will be available to advertiser  who could use a space-\\nbas video of their logo or ad print on the Banner in a TV\\ncommercial, a film from the Mir.\\n   The second development, ha been that Space Market Inc, the\\nsame company responsible for merchandi space on the Conestoga\\nbooster and COMET spacecraft, i now push the \"Environmental\\nBillboard\".  A laid out by SMI Chief Engineer Dr Ron Humble of the\\nUniversity of Colorado Space Laboratory and Preston Carter of the\\nLawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the \"Environmental\\nBillboard\" i a large inflatable outer support structure of up to\\n804x1609 meter   Adverti i carri by a mylar reflective area,\\ndeploy by the inflatable \\'frame\\'.\\n   To help sell the concept, the spacecraft responsible for\\nmaintain the billboard on orbit will carry \"ozone read sensor  to \"continuou monitor the condition of the Earth\\' delicate protective ozone layer,\" accord to Mike Lawson, head of\\nSMI. Furthermore, the inflatable billboard ha reach it minimum\\nexposure of 30 day it will be releas to re-enter the Earth\\' atmosphere. Accord to IMI, \"a the biodegradable material burn \\nit will release ozone-build component that will literal replenish the ozone layer.\" The remain spacecraft will monitor\\nthe atmosphere for another year before it, too, re-enter and burn up and \"add to the ozone supp \"\\n   Thi would not be a cheap advertisement, cost at least several\\nmillion of dollar (exact cost were not available).  But SMI\\nestimate that market exposure would be 3-5X that of the people who\\nwatch the SuperBowl, where a 30-second adverti \\'unit\\' cost\\n$600,000.  Since SMI i locat in Atlanta, Georgia, it i be promot a be available in time for the open of the 1996\\nSummer Olympic in Atlanta.\\n  \\nBut back to Brian\\' question \\n  \\n    See above. A for seriou -- if they can get $15-20 M or so (my\\nestimate of $5-10 for development cost and a flight unit, plu $10-15 M for a launch), then it\\' probab real.  They are claim to\\ntailor the orbit to overf specific location at specific time for\\noptimum adverti impact so they probab can\\'t piggy back upon\\nsomeone else\\' plann launch and will have to buy a dedicat launch.  That\\' a $10-15 M cost they ne to raise, right there.\\n    And there will probab be some legal challenge to thi a well.  Note there i one potential legal challenge to SMI on the use\\nof launch vehicle adverti already.  While I don\\'t think the\\nlegal challenge would win out (and ye  I am an amateur astronomer,\\nand no, I don\\'t real like the idea of thi additional light\\npollution, but I know of no prohibition of it...),  the legal\\nchallenge and court fight would probab remove any positive\\naspect of the adverti   I can imagine several way to make the\\nadvertiser look like lout for do thi -- which would change\\npositive market exposure to negative market exposure, and negate the\\nspace adverti advantage.  (Would you spend $15 M to look like an\\nidiot?)\\n   (And light pollution might not be too bad -- if it\\' in a low\\nenough orbit, and it relie upon reflect light on  it would\\non be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before\\ndawn.  For maximum market exposure, you want to have it visible just\\nafter dusk --minimiz impact on astronomy, since that\\' the time\\nof worse see due to day/night thermal turbulence.  It might still\\nbe a problem, but perhap there are way to mitigate thi ..)\\n    A for hav real fund -- none that I can identify.

The projectile be us in test i a 5 kg cylinder of Lexan plastic, 4 in in diameter\\nand about 50 cm long.\\n\\nAll of the acceleration come from the expansion of the hydrogen\\nga from 50,000 psi downward until the projectile leave the\\nbarrel.

Bacteria and viruse do not exist to cause disease. They are just another manifest of\\na general principle of evolution - on replication save replicator from degradiation.

But the fact i that you don\\'t know that\\n: Satan i not responsible, and neither do I.\\n: \\n: Suppose that a powerful, evil be like Satan exist   Would it\\n: be inconceivable that he might be responsible for many of the ill : that affect mankind?  I don\\'t think so.\\n\\nHe could have done a much better Job. (Pun intend ) The problem i \\nit seem no Satan i necessary to explain any disease  they are\\njust a inevitable a any product of evolution.\\n\\n: Did I say that?  Where?  Seem to me like another bad inference.\\n: Actual what you\\'ve done i to oversimplify what I said to the\\n: point that your summary of my word take on a new context.  I\\n: never said that people are \"meant\" (presumab by God) \"to be\\n: punish by gett disease .

Gay people are and will\\ncon- tinue to be persecut a long a such propaganda petpetuate   You may\\nbe unaware of all the statistica \"finding  concern African-American that\\nhave been publish and us by variou group to re-enforce their own bia against African-American   We usual think of the KKK in these instance \\nbut there are many other group   Of course, the vast majority of the public\\nscoff at such finding and document today, but that wa not alway the case.\\nFortunate African-American had \"white  who support their \\'cause\\' and\\npublic sentiment wa eventual (if not entire  turn around.  There wa even a Civil War, and anti-negro sentiment increas   In fact, until law were put in place to protect the inalienable right of Black it wa pretty\\nmuch legal to discriminate against them.\\n\\nI know many gay and I will NOT turn my back on them or their right to be free\\nform discrimination.  You may think that I have been deceiv or someth \\nthat i your perogative.  My church, Christian Church (Disciple of Christ)\\nopen affirm the right of oppress people of all segment of society,\\ninclud gay   We believe the Gospel message of preach to all creation\\nand mak disciple   We believe in the Lord\\' great commandment to Love,\\nand we beleive in stand up for the oppress  even if it i not popular\\nto do so.  I real like my church for last reason the most.  I can find a\\nchurch almost anywhere in the valley that stand for the Gospel and believe in the commandment of Love (though I\\'m hard-press to find many who actual sho Love), but not many are will to champion the oppress  especial within their own community.  I may have lost face with the greater Christian\\ncommunity for the unpopularity of my belief  but so did the abolitionist against the oppression of African-American   Many were even kill and\\ntreat a runaway slave for be \"nigger-lover  and such.  I gue I\\'ve\\ndecid the challenge i worth it.\\n\\nIn my talk with gay men and women I have heard tragic story after tragic\\nstory center around fail marriage  wive and husband who are straight\\nwho have been hurt in the proce  etc.  Funny th i  I don\\'t know of one\\ncase where the parent  ex-wive  or even children have continu to reject\\ntheir gay fami member (son, daughter, ex-husband, father, etc.) after they\\nbegan to take part in some form of support group, like PFLAG.\\n\\nI\\'m apall by the legislation which pass in Colorado, and am equal out0\\nrag that such slimey people a Loui Sheldon (from the Tradition Value Coalition) have been active work in the Christian underground to garner\\nsupport within several (8 I believe) state thi com November for more\\noppressive legisation against gay \\n\\nPerhap you don\\'t get it, and maybe you never will.  Many didn\\'t get it in the\\nMiddle Age and the proclaim God\\' will be done a they massacr thousand in witch hunt and inquisition \\n\\nThe message that come through, loud and clear, by proponent against gay\\nright and against gay in general, i that there i a strong dislike, even\\nhatr for gay  whether you want to call it such or not (it doesn\\'t change\\nthe result .  The major flaw in all thi postur i that in the end, the\\nfinal effect of post like that of your and Mr. Hudson i that YOU have a\\n\"conditional\" love for gay   Condition:  Change and we\\'ll love you. Thi i sure strange com from a group who claim that God ha an \"unconditional\"\\nlove, one that call people \"just a they are.\"  Sure there are thing that\\nwill \\'natural  change, and habit (like alcoholism, wife beat  etc.) that\\nne to be chang through some sort of therapy.  But then there are thing like left-handedne  etc. that no amount of beat it out of people, i go to result in anyth more than an outward conforminty to \"other\\npeople\\' expectation \" In the proce thi coerc conformity cause many\\npeople a great deal of harm, especial when it i caus by people who have\\nnoth more to gain from it that to become even more puff up about their\\nown sense of pseuper-spirituality.\\n\\nThi i sad, but I thorough believe that one day it will change.  It may be\\nunpopular to cry for justice and equality when the basi ha to do with\\nsometh very personal like \\'sexuality\\' (a taboo subject even today), but I\\nfirm believe in the right of individual to be free from impose regulation\\non thier bedroom   It\\' funny that most straight people have successful remov restrictive and oppressive legislation against invasive legislation,\\nbut we like to maintain thi little chestnut of repression...a though it\\nhelp u maintain a sense of superiority over at least one segment of society.\\nGay people are not criminal \\n\\nAnother interest th happen recent   A very prominent charismatic\\nchurch in the Silicon Valley (here) had two of it\\' pastor arrest for self-\\nadmitt charge of pederasty (men hav sex with boy .  Thi had apparent been go on for some time (a couple year ), but since the charge were\\nvoluntary, and the church work close with the police, so I imagine that\\nwa how they manag to downplay it in the media.  How could such a th happen when the church, itself, ha an ex-gay ministry?  One of my friend recent told me he wa \"approach  by someone who i go through the\\nreparitive therapy there, and he wa thorough convinc that the request for\\ndinner wa not an invitation to attend the ministry.\\n\\nThese are difficult time we live in, but provid hostile environment and\\ncreat and perpetuat an atmosphere that bre hate and violence i not\\nthe call of the Christian community.  The result of the pa amendment in\\nColorado ha creat an organization who\\' poster are appear all over\\nColorado call \" T.R.A.I.G.H.T.\" (I forget the whole definition off hand,\\nbut the last part wa Against Immoral Gro Homosexual Trash) and their motto\\ni \"Work for a fag-free America\" with an implicit advocation for violence.\\n\\nThi i sick, and it seem to be what you and Mr. Hudson, and other are\\nembrac \\n\\nWe Christian have a LOOOOOOOOOONG tradition of coersion and oppression\\ntoward those we feel don\\'t \\'measure up\\', and constant beratement from\\norganization like The Christian Research Institute, while they do have a good\\npurpose also, their major work seem to be find new and better way of\\nexclud people.\\n\\nThe Gospel I believe i not so negative, rather it seek way to \"include\"\\npeople.  I have several of Dr. Martin\\' book and find them quite helpful,\\nespecial concern \\'cult \\' But it seem that CRI, ha become a cult unto\\nitself.

Their god did not care much about people\\nof other nation  \\n\\nAt the time of the NT, thing were quite different - the Jew were under rule of an _empire_, and could no longer simp ignore\\nthe Gentile  A new situation requir a new morality, and along\\nwith it a new religion wa born.

Any value judgement must be prefac by the disclaimer\\n: that it i noth more than a matter of personal opinion and carrie : no weight in any \"absolute\" sense.\\n\\nIt look like you haven\\'t bother to read philosophy. Whenever there\\ni an observer, there i a subjective point of view, which may \\nvalue it existence and happine (even if that were just a result\\nof some physical event), and other\\' happine  too, if the observer\\ncome to think about it. In an absolute objective sense, that i \\nwithout any observer or subject  moral judgment lose their\\nmean  \\n\\nIt i not possible for a value to simp exist without a point of\\nview.

That your\\n: objection -seem- well found i due to the way you\\'ve been\\n: condition  there i no \"truth\" content.

Any observer or thinker, any personal be \\nha it own point of view.

In thi context Matthew 5:14-19 make sense.  Matt 5:17 \"Do not think that I [Jesu  came to abolish the Law or\\nthe Prophet  I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.\"  Jesu liv under the Jewish law.  However, He wa the culmination of the promise of the Prophet   He came to *fulfill* the prophecie and ful obey\\nGod\\' purpose \\n\\nVerse 18 say \"For tru I say to you, until heaven and earth pa away, not the smallest letter or stroke shall pa away from the Law,\\nuntil all i accomplish \"  The key to thi verse IMHO i the last \\nphrase.  Jesu  a the fulfillment of the law, \"accomplish  what the \\nLaw wa suppos to accomplish.  \\n\\nVerse 19:  \"Whoever then annul one of the least of these commandment \\nand so teache other  shall be call least in the kingdom of heaven;\\nbut whoever keep and teache them, he shall be call great in the\\nkingdom of heaven.\"  Taken in the context of Jesu teach Jewish \\npeople about liv live under the law, thi make sense.\\n\\nIn general, it appear that Jesu i respond to some criticism he \\nmust have receiv about \"do away with the Law.\"  That wa not \\nJesu  intent at all.  He had come to earth to live the Law a it \\nshould be liv and fulfill the promise made by God to hi \\npeople all the way back to Eve [Gen 3:15-The serpent will bruise your \\nheel, but *He* will bruise hi head.]  Jesu appear to be \"do \\naway with the Law\" because he did not honor the tradition of men a \\nequal to the Law of God.  He regular lock horn with the religiou \\nleader of the day because he would not conform to *their* rule  on \\nGod\\' Law.\\n\\nIn the Matthew passage Jesu i defend hi dedication to the Law \\nand defend himself against hi accusor   Almost the entire Sermon \\non the Mount (Matt. 5-7) i dedicat to help the Jewish people \\nunderstand the true intent of the Law, sweep away the clutter which \\nhad been introduc by the Pharasee and their tradition \\n\\nIn Galatian 3:23-26, Paul describe the relationship of Jesu to the \\nLaw in thi way:\\n\\n[23] But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, be \\nshut up to the faith which wa later to be reveal   [24] Therefore \\nthe Law ha become our tutor to lead u to Christ, that we may be \\njustifi by faith.  [25]  But now that faith ha come, we are no \\nlonger under a tutor.  [26] For you are all son of God through faith \\nin Christ Jesu \\n\\nI believe thi say that after Christ wa reveal  the Law had \\nserv it\\' purpose, i.e. \"our tutor to lead u to Christ,\" and\\nnow, \"we are no longer under a tutor.\"  The law ha been \"fulfill  \\na Christ said he would do.\\n\\nGod, the author of the old Law, and the Christ/Man, Jesu  are the same\\npersonality.  Therefore, the old Law and the new Testament (the \"last\\nwill and testament\" of Jesu  are bas on the same moral principle  \\nIt make sense that many of the principle in the old Law are\\nre-express in Christianity. \\n\\nOn the other hand, now that the Law ha fulfill it\\' purpose and \\nChristian relate to God through Christ, not the Law, it also make \\nsense that new practice and new symbolism were establish to \\nrepresent the \"mysterie  of thi new relationship.  i.e. Baptism \\nrepresent Christ\\' death, burial, and resurrection (Rom. 6:3-8),\\nThe Lord\\' supper a a memorial to Hi sacrifice (I Cor. 11:26), and\\nSunday a a day of worship commemorat Hi resurrection (Matt 28:1ff,\\nAct 20:7)\\n\\nOK, That\\' one Christian\\' explanation.  I don\\'t claim to have all\\nthese issue complete settl even in my own mind and I welcome\\nother Christian to offer other alternative \\n\\nPlease excuse the long post   Thank for your interest if you have read \\nthi far...', '', u'\\nI have heard that the sabbath wa original determin by the phase of\\nthe moon, and had element of moon worship.

If no signal i reciev  the spacecraft goe back to\\nthe safe mode for another time period.

If someone can receive it,\\ngreat, if not, so it\\' lost and no big deal.\\nBy mak the time and signal location general known, perhap someone in the world might be able and will to intercept the\\ndata even if they\\'re not will to contact the spacecraft.\\n\\nI see thi a be particular useful for spacecraft which\\ncould have an otherwise long life and are in or are go to\\nplace which are otherwise unaccessible (Jupiter/Saturn Orbit,\\nexit the solar system, etc).   \\n\\nPerhap those design future spacecraft (Cassini, Pluto Flyby,\\netc) should consider design in a \"pause\" mode in case their\\nspacecraft get the ax sometime in the future after completion of\\nthe primary mission.

Once everyone agree that the given set i inde all there are, then argument among\\nthe alternative can be presentent, and one most like to be true can be deduc by exclud all other possible alternative \\n\\nHowever, if it can be shown that the set i not all inclusive, then any conclusion base on the \\nincomplete set are invalid, even if the true choice i one of the original choice   I have given at \\nleast one valid alternative, so the conclusion that JC i the real McCoy just because he isn\\'t one of\\nthe other two alternative i no longer valid.\\n\\n->\\tSome other thing to note.

He lov u enough to die and save u so we should do the \\n->same.  Hey we can\\'t do it, God himself inspire u to turn our live \\n->over to him.  That\\' tuff and most people don\\'t want to do it, to be a \\n->real Christian would be someth for the strong to persevere at.  But \\n->just like weight lift or guitar play  drum  whatever it take \\n->time.  We don\\'t rush it in one day, Christianity i your whole life.  \\n->It i not go to church once a week, or help poor people once in \\n->a while.

God i above these boxe and should be \\n->carri with u into all these boxe that we have creat for \\n->ourselve   \\n\\nHere I agree with you.  Anyone who buy into thi load of mythology should take what it say \\nseriou  and what it say i that it must be a total way of life.  I have very little respect for \\nXian that don\\'t.

Men and women are\\ndifferent ... physical  physiological  and psychological   Much\\nrecent evidence for thi statement i present in the book \"Brainsex\" by\\nAnne Moir and David Jessel.  I recommend you find a copy and read it.\\nTheir book i an overview of recent scientific research on thi topic\\nand i well referenc  \\n\\nNow, if women and men are different in some way  the law can on adequate take into account their ne in these area where they are\\ndifferent by also tak into account the way in which men and women\\nare different.  Maternity leave i an example of thi -- it take into\\naccount that women get pregnant.  It doe not give women the same rule it would give to men, because to treat women like it treat men in thi instance would be unjust.  Thi i just simp an obviou example of\\nwhere men and women are intrinsical different!!!!!\\n\\nNow, people make the _naive_ argument that sexism = oppression.\\nHowever, maternity leave i sexist because MEN DO NOT GET PREGNANT. \\nMen do not have the same acce to leave that women do (not to the same\\nextent or degree), and therefore IT I SEXIST.  No matter however much a\\nman _wants_ to get pregnant and have maternity leave, HE NEVER CAN.  And\\ntherefore the law I SEXIST.  No man can have acce to maternity leave,\\nNO MATTER HOW HARD HE TRIE TO GET PREGNANT.  I hope thi i clear.\\n\\nMaternity leave i an example where a sexist law i just, because the\\nsexism here just reflect the \"sexism\" of nature in mak men and women\\ndifferent.  There are many other difference between men and women which\\nare far more subtle than pregnancy, and to find out more of these I\\nrecommend you have a look at the book \"Brainsex\".\\n\\nYour point that perhap some day men can also be pregnant i fallaciou \\nIf men can one day become pregnant it will be by hav biological become women!  To have a womb and the other factor requir for\\npregnancy i usual wrapp up in the definition of what a woman i --\\nso your argument, when it i examin  i seen to be fallaciou   You\\nare say that men can have the sexist maternity leave privilege that \\nwomen can have if they also become women -- which actual just support my statement that maternity leave i sexist.\\n\\n\\nThere i no official priesthood in Islam -- much of thi function i taken by Islamic scholar   There are female Islamic scholar and\\nfemale Islamic scholar have alway exist in Islam.

The report acknowledge that many well-\\nknown Christian are and have been Mason  and note that many teaching of Masonry are \"supportive of Christian faith and practice\".  Example of\\nthe latter include belief in God, emphase on honesty and integrity, and\\nthat some Masonic lodge incorporate explicit Christian belief \\n\\nOn the other hand, they note that some aspect of Masonry are incompatible\\nwith Southern Baptist principle   These includ the use of title which some\\npeople consider sacrilegiou  the tak of certain oath (even though they\\nare not meant seriou , the \"undeniab pagan and/or occultic\" writing of\\nsome Masonic leader  the implication in some Masonic writing that salvation\\ncan be achiev by good work  and the racial discrimination practic by many\\nMasonic lodge   (I note with some chagrin that Baptist churche a a whole\\naren\\'t real in a place to speak on thi last point.)\\n\\n\\nThe report conclude that Masonry i not a religion, and say that membership\\nshould not be endors or censur  but left to the discretion of individual \\nThi wa in part because there i variation among different Masonic Lodge \\nand while one may include element strong against Christianity, another may\\nnot.

I\\'ll try\\n    to interpret.\\n\\n    1)\\tWe wait until the Shuttle clear the tower before roll \\n\\n    2)\\tThen, we roll the Shuttle around so that the angle of attack\\n\\tbetween the wind caus by passage through the atmosphere (the\\n\\t\"relative wind\") and the chord of the wing (the imaginary line\\n\\tbetween the lead edge and the trail edge) i a slight \\tnegative angle (\"a negative q-alpha\").\\tThi cause a little bit of\\n\\t\"downward\" force (toward the bel of the Orbiter, or the +Z\\n\\tdirection) and thi force \"alleviate structural load \"\\n\\tWe have to be careful about those wing -- they\\'re about the\\n\\tmost \"delicate\" part of the vehicle.\\n\\n    3)\\tThe new attitude (after the roll) also allow u to carry more\\n\\tma to orbit, or to achieve a higher orbit with the same ma  or\\n\\tto change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be\\n\\tthe case if we didn\\'t roll (\"performance gain\").\\n\\n    4)\\tThe new attitude allow the crew to f a le complicat \\tflight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerou abort\\n\\tmaneuver  the Return To Launch Site (\"decreas abort maneuver\\n\\tcomplexity\").\\n\\n    5)\\tThe new attitude improve the ability for ground-bas radio\\n\\tantennae to have a good line-of-sight signal with the  band radio\\n\\tantennae on the Orbiter (\"improv  band look angle ).\\n\\n    6)\\tThe new attitude allow the crew to see the horizon, which i a\\n\\thelpful (but not mandatory) part of pilot any f machine.\\n\\n    7)\\tThe new attitude orient the Shuttle so that the body i \\tmore near parallel with the ground, and the nose to the east\\n\\t(usual .  Thi allow the thrust from the engine to add velocity\\n\\tin the correct direction to eventual achieve orbit.  Remember:\\n\\tvelocity i a vector quantity made of both spe and direction.\\n\\tThe Shuttle ha to have a large horizontal component to it \\tvelocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit.\\n\\n    Thi all beg the question, \"Why isn\\'t the launch pad orient to give\\n    thi nice attitude to begin with?  Why doe the Shuttle ne to roll to\\n    achieve that attitude?\"  The answer i that the pad were leftover     from the Apollo day   The Shuttle straddle two flame trenche -- one\\n    for the Solid Rocket Motor exhaust, one for the Space Shuttle Main\\n    Engine exhaust.  (You can see the effect of thi on any daytime\\n    launch.  The SRM exhaust i dirty gray garbage, and the SSME exhaust i     fluffy white steam.  Watch for the difference between the \"top\"\\n    [Orbiter side] and the \"bottom\" [External Tank side] of the stack.) The\\n    acce tower and other support and service structure are all orient     basical the same way they were for the Saturn V\\'   (A side note: the\\n    Saturn V\\' also had a roll program.  Don\\'t ask me why -- I\\'m a Shuttle\\n    guy.)\\n\\n    I check with a buddy in Ascent Dynamic \\tHe add that the \"roll\\n    maneuver\" i real a maneuver in all three axe  roll, pitch and yaw.\\n    The roll component of that maneuver i perform for the reason     stat   The pitch component control load on the wing by keep     the angle of attack (q-alpha) within a tight tolerance.  The yaw\\n    component i us to determine the orbital inclination.

I never said that the Law wa made\\n: obsolete by Jesu \\n\\nJust for reference, here' the earlier quote:\\nMalcolm Lee (mlee@post.RoyalRoad ca) wrote in reference to Leviticu 21:9\\nand Deuteronomy 22:20-25:\\n: These law written for the Israelite  God' chosen people whom God had\\n: expre set apart from the rest of the world.

Depend on how they use thi knowledge, they can be scary.  They can argue any position they desire, and\\nback it up with select part of the Bible.  Such Pharisee include David\\nKoresh and Adolph Hitler.  I will qualify thi by say *I don't know* if\\nthey actual believ what they were preach  but the end certain made the mean look frighten \\n\\nHowever, just a scary are those that don't know much of the Bible, but\\nbelieve every word.  In fact, thi i probab scarier, since there are far\\nmore of these people, from what I've seen.  In addition, they are very easy\\nto manipulate by the aforemention Pharisee  since they don't know enough\\nto debate with these people.\\n\\n: Christianity i not just a set of rule  it' a lifestyle that change one' : perspective and personal conduct.

One of the best\\nreference though, \"Robinson\\' Greek and English Lexicon of the New\\nTestament,\" not on stat the translation, it gave both the root word  the\\nliteral translation, relat greek word which use the same root  and also\\nother present specific example of the word in greek literature (to give\\nfurther context).  \\n\\nThe word \"apagchw\" ha two root word  \"gchw\" i the \"to strangle\" root, and\\nthe root word \"apo\" mean literal \"away.\" Thi root word i includ in\\nword which denote a transition.  It can mean a transition in place (eg: the\\ngreek word \"apagello\" mean to send a message).  \"Apo\" can also denote a\\nchange in state and specifical the change from life to death.  Robinson\\nspecifical make comparison to the word \"apokteiuo,\" which mean \"to kill.\"\\nIn literal mean the word \"apacgw\" mean \"to throttle, strangle to put out\\nof the way,\" and implicit denote a change in life state (ie: away from\\nlife, to death).  So while the word \"apacgw\" doe mean \"to hang,\" it\\nspecifical denote a death a well.  Thu Robinson i quite specific when he\\nstate that it mean \"to hang oneself, to end one\\' life by hang \" He then\\nnote the the use of \"apacgw\" in Homer Odessy 19:230 to denote context.  He\\npresent that example of \"apacgw\" a be us to explicit mean \"suicide by\\nhang \" Now since there i a perfect good word for strangl  without the\\nadd denotation of \"death,\" and a you insist that the Bible wa written by\\nGod, and every word i precice correct, you are stuck with the complete\\nmean of \"apacgw\" (ie: Since the word \"apacgw\" wa us  then death i denot a the result). \\n\\nBy the way, I note that Mr DeCenso also present an example of \"apacgw\":\\n\\n\\nNote Mr DeCenso, a you say, the Septuagint wa a translation from Hebrew to\\nGreek, and you have not shown the original mean of the Hebrew (ie\" the the\\nHebrew say \"and di ), and thu whether it wa simp echo in the Greek. \\nIt should also be point out that, regardle of the add \"and di , the\\ncorrect translation would still be \"apacgw,\" a the man did inde die from\\nstrangulation (redundant, but correct).  Further, we have evidence that the\\nSeptuagint wa repeat rewritten and reedit (which includ version which contradict each other), and such edit wa not even necessari execut by Greek   Thu I am not sure that you can use the Septuagint a it\\nnow stand  a a paragon of ancient greek.  So, what you real ne to prove\\nyour point Mr DeCenso, i an example, in ancient greek, of someone committ \"apacgw\" and surviv   Otherwise I would see you a simp mak worthle assertion without correspond evidence. \\n\\nNow I would note Mr DeCenso, that everytime I go out of my way to research it\\none of your apparent contriv exegisi  I pretty much find it false.  Thu \\nI think that if you are go to add to the text, someth over and above\\nwhat the source clear say  then you had better have an explicit Greek or\\nhistorical source to justify it. \\n\\nBy the way, a to Mr Rose\\' statement about tree around the Potter\\' Field:\\n\\n\\nUnle Mr Rose can show that these tree are two thousand year old, or that\\nthere are 2000 year old stump there, or ha a 2 thousand year old description\\nof the area which mention such tree  then it i inappropriate for him to\\nassert that the present placement of tree prove the location of the tree two\\nthousand year ago (after all, thing change). \\n\\nNow a to your other argument, ie: that the money Juda us i not the same\\na the 30 silver \\n\\n\\nTrue, Peter (or the author of Act  doe not specifical call Juda  betrayal\\n\"an iniquity,\" but for that matter, neither doe John specifical call Juda \\naction \"an iniquity\" either.  Further John 13:29 did not say that Juda took\\n\\n    \"Some thought that because, Juda had the money box, Jesu wa tell      him \"Buy what we ne for the feast\"; or that he should give someth      to the poor, So after receiv the morsel he immediate went out, and\\n     it wa night.\"\\n\\nNote that it i said that Juda left, it doe not say that he took the money\\nbox.  Thu when I see your explanation it still seem to me you would choose\\nthe a an unproven iniquity, mention by another author, in a different\\nbook, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicit mention by\\nthe author of act   I find thi forc and contriv  \\n\\nOf course thi particular argument become moot, since we have have seen\\nevidence that \"apacgw\" mean suicide.  You see, since Juda  hang wa successful, he could not have spent the money mention in John 13:29, because\\nMatthew and Mark explicit say the betrayal wa on the high ho day (ie:\\nPassover), and thu he could not have spent the money before kill himself\\nthe next day.  Thu the money which bought the \"Field of Blood\" would have to\\nhave been the 30 piece of silver (Of course he got the 30 piece of silver\\nthat night a well, and thu couldn\\'t have spent that either.

The scribe Matthew i perhap the most eager to draw out what he think are prophetic answer in\\nthe career of Jesu of Nazareth.  A you will see, Matthew\\' main\\nstrategy i to take variou Old Testament passage  often not even\\nabout the promis Messiah, and app them to the circumstance in\\nthe New Testament.  We must also bear in mind the question of the\\nauthenticity of the account   Since the gospel were written at\\nleast 35 year after Jesu wa execut  we do not know how much\\nhappen exact a stat   But, for purpose of analysi  we\\nwill take particular claim at face value.\\n\\nImmanuel:\\n\\n       We begin, of course, at the beginn \\n\\n       (Mt 1.21-22):  \"[Mary] will bear a son, and you,\\n       Joseph, will name him \\'Jesu  (which mean G\\'d i        salvation), for he will save hi people from their\\n       sin \"  All thi happen to fulfil what the lord had\\n       spoken by a prophet:\\n\\n       [Isaiah 7.1-16]:  In the day of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),\\n       k of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of Israel made\\n       war on Jerusalem (capitol of Judah), but could not\\n       quite conquer it.  When the house of David (i.e. Ahaz\\n       and hi court in Judah) were told of thi  ...it        heart and the heart of it people shook...   And, the\\n       lord G\\'d said to Isaiah, \"go to meet with Ahaz...\" \\n       ...And the lord spoke to Ahaz (through prophet Isaiah,\\n       natural  say  \"Ask a sign of G\\'d your lord.  It\\n       can be a deep a Sheol or a high a heaven.\"  But,\\n       Ahaz said, \"I won\\'t ask; I will not put the lord to a\\n       test.\"  Then (Isaiah) said, \"Hear then, O house of\\n       David.  I it not enough for you to weary men, that\\n       you must weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord\\n       himself will give you a sign:  Behold, a young woman\\n       i with child and will bear a son, and name him\\n       \"Immanuel,\" which mean  \"G\\'d i with u \"   He will\\n       eat curd and honey when he know how to refuse evil\\n       and choose good.  For, before the child know how to\\n       refuse evil and choose good, the land of the two king        you dread will have been desert ..\\n\\nMatthew home in on just the sentence that i in italic  \\nFurther, he the Hebrew word \"almah,\" (young woman), a specifical  \"virgin.\"  But, thi i not a prophecy about the\\nMessiah.  It i not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 year later.  It i not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  In\\nshort, it not about Jesu   Matthew ha made use of a verse out of\\ncontext, and trie to make it fit the specific case of Mary.  It\\nshould be not that if we want to read the prophecy in a general\\nmanner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary,\\nvirgin or not, wa inde a young woman with child.  Of course,\\nthe fit i shady and ha problem   Jesu  while thought of by\\nlater Christian to be G\\'d walk among men, wa never call by\\nthe name, Immanuel.  If Christianity wish to claim thi prophecy\\nfor Jesu  it become at best a cut-and-paste prophecy... a second\\ncla prophecy.   Not too convinc \\n\\nEgypt:\\n\\n       After Jesu  birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tell about a\\nquick (and elsewhere unmention  excursion to Egypt, a if he\\nwishe to liken Jesu to Mose   Thi wa done to escape an\\nalleg infanticidal rampage of the k  Herod.\\n\\n       [Mt 2.15]  ...and remain there until the death of\\n       Herod.  Thi wa to fulfil what the lord had spoken:\\n       \"Out of Egypt I have cal-l my son.\"\\n\\n\\nWhat the lord real said wa thi \\n\\n       [Hosea 11.1]  When Israel wa a child, I lov him. \\n       And, out of Egypt I call my son.  The more I call        them (my people), the more they went from me; they\\n       kept sacrific to the Ba\\'al  and kept burn        incense to idol \\n\\nMatthew convenient omit the rest of Hosea\\' oracle.  But, it\\nwa inde Israel that, once call out of Egypt, want to\\nreturn.  Thi i history.  Jesu i certain not be spoken of\\nhere.  And, if we are to draw some kind of parallel here, we wind\\nup with a Jesu that flee and resist G\\'d.   Again, thi prophecy\\ni just not a convinc a Matthew probab had hop \\n\\nRachel Weep \\n\\n        While Jesu i off vacation in Egypt, Matthew say that\\nK Herod sought to kill him, and thu order the execution of\\nall young male children.  Matthew then write \\n\\n       [Mt 2.17-18]   By thi  that which wa spoken by the\\n       prophet Jeremiah wa fulfill \\n\\n       \"A voice wa heard in Ramah, wail and loud\\n       lamentation-- Rachel weep for her children;\\n       she refus to be consol  because they were\\n       no more.\"   \\n\\nThe reference i to a passage in Jeremiah 31.15, referr to the\\ncarry off of Israel into exile by Sargon (of Assyria) in 722\\nBCE.  Rachel, the ancestor of the major tribe of Israel, Ephraim,\\nand Manasseh, i said to weep for her descendant who are \"no\\nmore.\"  It i metaphorical, of course, since Rachel liv and die before the Hebrew were even in the Egyptian exile.\\n       It i interest to note that it wa Leah, not Rachel, who\\nwa the ancestor of the Judean (the land where Jesu and\\nBethlehem were).  If anyone should do weep for her \"children,\"\\nit i Leah.  The on connexion that Rachel ha with Bethlehem i that the legend have it that she wa buri north of the city,\\n\"on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem).\"\\n       A for Herod and hi infanticide, it i rather unlike that such an event actual occurr   One never know  but the\\nevent i not mention or allud to anywhere else in the Bible,\\nnor i it mention in any of the secular record of the time. \\nHerod wa particular unlik in hi reign, and many far le evil de of Herod were careful record   Thi might be a\\nprime example of how event were add to Jesu  life to enhance\\nthe message of the church\\' gospel.\\n       Because of the whole story\\' similarity to the tale of the\\ninfant Mose in Egypt, it i high like that it i a device set\\nup by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Jesu \\nIt i not surpri that Matthew convenient neglect to mention\\nthe rest of the Jeremiah quote.   The \"children\" the prophet\\nspeak of are not dead, but exil in the Assyrian Empire.  G\\'d\\ncomfort the weep Rachel, say that the children will be\\nreturn - he will gather them back together.  Of course, thi would not suit Matthew\\' purpose, a the children he speak of are\\ndead for good.  Again, the \"prophecy\" Matthew set up i not even\\nthat, and to anyone who bother to check it out, i not too\\nconvinc \\n\\nThe Nazarene:\\n\\n       We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find\\nanother Matthean prophecy.  After leav Egypt, Joseph & wife\\ntake the infant Jesu to live in the city of Nazareth, \\n\\n       [Mt 2.23]  ...that what wa spoken of by the prophet        might be fulfill  \"He shall be call a Nazarene.\"\\n\\nFirst th we notice i that Matthew doe not mention the name of\\nthe prophet(  thi time.  Second, we have to ask who \"He\" i  \\nThere are no Messianic prophecie speak of a Nazarene.  Worse,\\nthere are no prophecie  period, mention a Nazarene.  Still\\nworse, there are no Nazarene mention in the Old Testament at\\nall.  In the book of Judge  an angel tell Samson\\' mother that\\nshe will,\\n\\n       [Judge 13.5]  \"...conceive and bear a son.  No razor\\n       shall tough hi head, for he will be a Nazirite to hi        god from the day of hi birth.  He will deliver Israel\\n       from the hand of the Philistine \"\\n\\nThi i of course not a prophecy of Jesu  or the messiah of G\\'d. \\nBut, it i the best that can be found.  Obviou  Matthew ha begun to go overboard in cut-and-paste prophecie  in that he i simple mak them up now.\\n\\nBear our\\nDisease \\n\\n       Jesu next goe around heal people of physical illnesse and disabilitie \\n\\n       [Mt 8.17]   Thi wa to fulfil what wa spoken by the\\n       prophet Isaiah, \"He took our infirmitie and bore our\\n       disease \"\\n\\nA expect  the verse quot in Isaiah i quot out of context,\\nand a few word are skew to fit the Christian scheme.  We have,\\n\\n       [I 53.4]  Sure he, [the suffer servant], ha        borne our sickne  and carri our pain \\n\\nFrom a read of the surround passage in Isaiah, we know that\\nthe prophet i speak in present tense of the collective nation\\nof Israel, Jehovah\\' chosen servant and people.  He speak to the\\nIsraelite suffer in exile, in the voice of the gentile nation that look upon it.  Thi image i deep ingrain in Jewish\\nidentity --an image of a chastis  yet cherish  Israel a the\\ninstrument of the nation  salvation by G\\'d.\\n      The verse speak of Israel tak on the sicknesse which\\nare the literal and metaphorical manifestation of guilt and\\ndiscipline.  They do not speak of a \"servant\" go around and\\nheal people.  Notice that the servant in Isaiah take on the\\nsicknesse and pain of the nation (and individual Jew .  Jesu \\na we all know, did not take the disease onto himself.  The\\nverse here in Isaiah are not a prophecy of someth to come, but\\nrather someth that had already happen   While it i believ that Jesu took on the eternal punishment of hell, he did not bear\\nthe illnesse he heal   So, while someone might want to say\\nthat, figurative  Jesu reenact the de of Israel in hi spiritual atonement, he ha to admit that Matthew\\' parallel\\nmisse where he intend it to have it effect.\\n\\n\\nSilent Messiah:\\n\\n      Upon heal multitude of commoner  it i said that Jesu order them to keep quiet, presumable so that he wouldn\\'t arouse\\nthe attention of the local ruler \\n\\n       [Mt 12.15-21]  Thi wa to fulfill what wa spoken by\\n       the prophet Isaiah.   \\n\\n       \"Behold my servant whom I have chosen, my belov \\n       with whom my soul i pleas   I will put my spirit on\\n       him, and he will announce justice to the Gentile   He\\n       will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear\\n       hi voice in the street   He will not break a bruis        re or quench a smolder wick until he bring        justice to victory, and the gentile will hope in hi        name.\"\\n\\nThe Isaiah passage quot read \\n\\n       [I 42.1-4]  Behold my servant whom I uphold, my\\n       chosen, in whom my soul delight   I have put my\\n       spirit on him, and he will br forth justice to the\\n       nation   We will not cry or lift up hi voice, or\\n       make it heard in the street.  He will not break a\\n       bruis re  or quench a smolder wick.  He will\\n       faithful br forth justice.  He will not fail\\n       (burn dim  or be discourag (bruis  until he ha        establish justice in the earth.  And the coastland        await hi law.\\n\\nYou see, Matthew ha convenient left out part of the passage,\\nbecause it doe not suit the dealing of Jesu   Christian could\\nnever think of Jesu fail  never would the \"light\" of mankind\\nburn dim   But, the servant nation of Israel will inde come to\\nan end when it job i done.  When the gentile come to embrace\\nG\\'d there will no longer be a chosen people, but rather all will\\nbe the children of G\\'d.  Also, the end phrase ha been chang from the Judaic \"...the coastland await hi law.\" to the\\nChristologic, \"the Gentile will hope in hi name.\"   While the\\noriginal proclaim the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrite it\\nto fit it strange doctrine of \"believ in the name.\"  If one\\nha any doubt the servant referr to i not Jesu  one ha on to read the whole chapter, Isaiah 42, and hear about the belov but blind and imperfect servant, \"a people robb and\\nplunder ..\"   So, we see that when Matthew\\' attempt at\\n\"prophecy\" i examin  it crumble \\n\\nThree Day and\\nThree Night \\n\\n      Now we come upon a prophecy suppos utter by the very\\nmouth of the god Jesu himself.  He speak of hi crucifixion and\\nresurrection.\\n\\n       [Mt 12.40]   For a Jonah wa in the bel of the\\n       whale for three day and three night  so will the Son\\n       of Man be in the heart of the earth three day and\\n       three night \\n\\nBefore any further discussion can occur, it i necessary to know\\nhow the Jew understood day   A far a day name went, each wa 24 hour long, last from sunset 6pm to the follow sunset\\n6pm.  What wa referr to a a \"day\" wa the period of light from\\n6am to the end sunset at 6pm.  Thu  accord to our time\\nscale, a sabbath day began at 6pm Friday even  and last until\\n6pm saturday even   Thi i why the Jew celebrate their\\nsabbath on the daylight portion of Saturday  instead of Sunday  \\n(It seem like a real miracle that Christian didn\\'t forget that\\nSaturday wa inde the seventh and last day of the week!)  Thu \\nwhen day and night are referr to together, 12 hour daylight\\nportion and 12 hour night period are be spoken of.  Thu \\nJesu say that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwise\\nunresurrect for three day and three night \\n\\n      A the good book tell u  Jesu wa crucifi on the \"ninth\\nhour,\" which i 3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then wa put into the\\ngrave sometime after that.  Then, Jesu left the grave, \"rose,\"\\nbefore dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the sabbath wa over).  What thi mean i that Jesu wa  u our time for\\nclarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to some time before\\n6am Sunday morn   We could also add a little time before 6pm\\nFriday, since the bible i not specific here.  What thi mean u Jewish time i that he wa in the grave for one day, two\\nnight  and possib a couple of hour of one day.  Certain thi i a problem for Jesu prediction.  There i absolute no way we\\nare even able to have hi death involve three day and three\\nnight --even u modern time measurement    We then are l to\\nsuspect that thi error i another one of Matthew\\' little\\nmistake  and that the gospel writer put false word into hi god\\' mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it i more\\nthan unconvinc .. it i counter-convinc \\n\\nHear &\\nUnderstand \\n\\n     Jesu tool on a habit of speak to hi vast audience in\\nparable - storie in which a deeper mean could be found, if\\nyou were already one of the elect, those chosen to understand the\\nmessage of Jesu   He reason that those who can understand the\\nparable are the one he want   If the people cannot understand\\nthem, there i no ne to bother with them, since they will not\\naccept the \"plain\" message any better.  Matthew say \\n\\n       [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] inde in\\n       fulfill the prophecy of Isaiah which say  \\n\\n       \"You will inde hear but never understand; and you\\n       will inde see, but never perceive.  Because thi        people\\' heart ha grown dull, their ear are heavy of\\n       hear  and they have shut their eye so the they\\n       would not perceive with them, her with their ear  and\\n       understand with their heart, and turn for me to heal\\n       them.\"\\n\\nThe original Isaiah passage are part of hi earlier work  hi call to the ministry.  Thi i in 740 BCE, when Israel i flourish  right before it fall under the authority of Assyria. \\nIsaiah see the good time end  and also a vision from G\\'d,\\ncall him to br reform to Israel and Judah.\\n\\n       [I 6.9-13]  And G\\'d said, \"Go, and say to thi        people, `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and\\n       see, but do not perceive.\\'   Make the heart of thi        people fat, make their ear heavy, and shut their\\n       eye  so they will not see with their eye  or hear\\n       with their ear  and understand with their heart  and\\n       turn and be heal \"  Then Isaiah said, \"How long,\\n       lord?\"  And he said, \"Until the citie lie waste\\n       without inhabitant, and house without men, and the\\n       land i utter desolate, and the G\\'d take men far\\n       away, and forsaken place are many in the land.  And\\n       though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burn        again, like a terebinth or an oak whose stump still\\n       stand when the tree i fell \" The ho se i it        stump.\\n\\nHere we see that it i real G\\'d who cause the people of Israel\\nto stop listen to the prophet\\' warning  but reaffirm the\\npromise made to Solomon\\' (and David\\'  se lineage.  If you read\\nthe rest of Isaiah, you find that thi i done to fulfil the plan\\nof G\\'d to use Israel a a servant, a light to the nation   (Look\\nat Isaiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)\\n     We see that Matthew ha cut-and-past just a little portion\\nof Isaiah\\' verse, to suit hi own gospel ne   More than that,\\nhe ha alter the word  to make it fit the people who didn\\'t\\nunderstand Jesu  storie   And, a we see, Isaiah\\' verse are\\nnot prophecie  but rather command from G\\'d to him, in the\\npresent.   Once again, Matthew\\' prophecy fall flat on it face. \\n\\n     Matthew trie again to make Jesu  parable look like they\\nhave the prophetic approval.\\n\\n       [Mt 13.35]  ...he said noth to them without a\\n       parable.  Thi wa to fulfil what wa spoken of by the\\n       prophet, \"I will open my mouth to them in parable   I\\n       will utter that which ha been hidden since the\\n       foundation of the world.\"\\n\\nMatthew real botche up here.  He attempt to quote not from a\\nprophet, but from the Psalm \\n\\n       [P 78.2-4]  I will open my mouth in parable.  I will\\n       utter dark saying of old, thing that we all have\\n       heard and known, thing that our father have told u  \\n       We will not hide them from their children, but tell to\\n       the com generation the gloriou de of the\\n       lord...\\n\\nA wa point out, the verse in the Psalm do not real come\\nfrom a prophet.  You might also want to know that earlier copie of Matthew\\' gospel even insert Isaiah\\' name a thi prophet. \\nApparent  later scribe caught the error and tri to cover some\\nof it up.\\n     Perhap the most significant part of thi i that, once\\nagain, Matthew ha alter the Old Testament Scripture   A Jesu ha said earlier, he speak in parable so that some will not\\nunderstand them.  The parable in the Psalm are not to be hidden. \\nFurther, they speak of thing \"known, that our father have told\\nu \"  Jesu deal with thing \"hidden since the foundation of the\\nworld.\"  Inde Jesu dealt in a lot of secrecy and confusion. \\nThi i in direct opposition to the parable in the Psalm   No\\nwonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And still once again,\\nMatthew\\' artificial prophecie fall flat on their face.  But,\\nChristian rare look at thi   Matthew\\' prophecie aren\\'t the\\non thing about Christianity that are beginn to look bad.\\n\\n\\nExcuse of\\nLittle Faith:\\n\\n       In Mt. 17.14-21, we see that the disciple are able to go\\naround cast out demon  except in one case.  Not know what\\nepilepsy wa  the people thought those with the disease were\\nposses with demon   It i no wonder that the disciple were\\nunable to \"disposse  the epileptic.  But, Jesu  perhap no more\\nenlighten than they, i report to have rebuk them, say they didn\\'t have enough faith.   Thi seem strange.  Why wa thi demon special?  It seem that either a true believer ha faith or\\nhe doe not.  Apparent  enough faith will allow someone to move\\nmountain   Of course, you will find no one, these day that can\\nmove real mountain   No one part sea   The on miracle the\\nCharismatic can speak of are those rumour to happen on trip to\\nMexico or some faraway place.  Major miracle are mak some old\\nwoman\\' arthriti feel better on Sunday morn T.V.\\n\\n       And the god  includ Jesu  are alway shroud in\\nancient lore and writing  protect from the skeptic in their\\nsacr past   They are either dead, sleep  or hid in\\nheaven, with people rumour about their imminent return and\\ntheir great miracle of day long gone.  Yet, life goe on.  \\n\\n     Tale of mystic  storie of miracle - all in a distant time\\nor a distant place.  God us to reveal themselve to men in the\\nold day  Jehovah too.  But, now they are silent.  All the\\ntheologian give are variou excuse a to why we don\\'t get to see\\nGod anymore.\\n\\n       We\\'re too lazy; we\\'re not zealou enough; we\\'re\\n       sinful; it\\' just hi \"plan\"; we put too many of our\\n       own demand on G\\'d\\' appearance; if we had the right\\n       faith, if we  were will to meet G\\'d on hi term ..\\n\\n     Yet, even the most piou of men have not seen G\\'d.  You, dear\\nreader, have not seen G\\'d.  Not literal  you know that to be\\ntrue. (I know that\\' presumptuou and bold.  But, search your\\nheart, you know what I mean.)  All that we\\'ve seen religion do i make people feel good and content about not see G\\'d.  They say\\nour little faith doe not merit u to see G\\'d.  Sometime  they\\nsay, \"See the love in these people you worship with... see the\\nlive of people change... that i see G\\'d.\"   Thu people get\\nlull to sleep, satisfi with turn G\\'d into the everyday\\nsight    But, that i not see G\\'d a I am speak of... it i not see G\\'d the way people us to see.  \\n      What we see in the world that i good, i the compassion of\\nhuman heart  the love given and taken by men and women, the\\nforgivene practis by Christian & Atheist alike, beauty creat by the mind of man.  These are the thing that are done; these are\\nwhat we see.  But, it i said thi i so on because everybody\\nha little faith.\\n\\x0c\\nJesu Ride on\\nan A \\n\\n       Short after accept the role of the Jewish messiah\\nk  Jesu request a donkey be brought in for him to ride into\\nJerusalem.  \\n\\n       [Mt 21.5]  Thi took place to fulfil what wa spoken\\n       by the prophet, say \\n\\n       Tell the daughter of Zion, \"Behold, your k i        com to you, humble, mount on an a  and on a\\n       a colt.\"\\n\\nOf course, the passage quot from Zechariah 9.9 read a little\\ndifferent \\n\\n       Lo, your k come to you; he i triumphant and\\n       victoriou  humble, and rid on an a  on an a \\n       colt... he will command peace to the nation \\n\\nThere isn\\'t all that much difference here, except that Zechariah\\non involve one animal  --an a colt--  while Matthew read the\\npoetic word slight different   Thu  he ha Jesu call for\\nboth a colt and an adult a   From Matthew\\' version, we get a\\ncomical picture of the divine Christ sweat it to straddle two\\ndonkey   Thi could inevitab lead to a theological,\\nproctological dilemma!   We find that in the account written\\nearlier by St. Mark, on the colt wa call for and brought to\\nJesu   Thi inde fit the verse of Zechariah proper  and\\nshow u that in Matthew attempt to use prophetic verse  he ha bungl   Now, exclud many respectable Christian I have met, I\\nhave notic that while Christ i thought to have ridden on asse \\nthe situation i often revers nowaday ..\\n\\n       Then, enter the Jerusalem temple, the priest were\\nanger at people and youngster call Jesu the messiah.  But,\\nJesu repli a we might expect Matthew to have done,\\n\\n       [Mt 21.16]  Haven\\'t you read?  `Out of the mouth of\\n       babe and suckling thou ha brought perfect praise.\\'\\n\\nIt i more like that Matthew made thi response up since Jesu wa never one to point out such little \"prophetic\" thing AND\\nsince, a we might expect, the quote i in error, which seem to\\nfit Matthew\\' track record quite well.  We might ask Jesu or\\nMatthew, \"Haven\\'t you read?\" for the source read \\n\\n       [Psalm 8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how majestic i        your name in the whole world!   You, whose glory i        chant above the heaven by babe and infant  you\\n       have found a bulwark against your foe to still the\\n       enemy and the avenger.\\n\\nThe passage hard ne comment.  There i no \"perfect praise\"\\nspoken of in the psalm, and what praise i there i given to G\\'d,\\nnot hi messiah k  and not Jesu   A mention  it seem to be\\njust one more case of Matthew\\' pen mak up convenient prophetic\\nscripture.\\n\\nYHVH said to \\nmy lord...:\\n\\n      Jesu i said to have ask from whom the promis Jewish\\nmessiah-k i to be descend   The Jew agree-- it i k David.  But, then Jesu counter by quot Psalm 110,\\n\\n       \"The LORD said to my Lord, sit at my right hand, until\\n       I put your enemie under your feet.\"\\n\\nTaken at face value, Jesu i deny the necessity of Davidic\\ndescent.  One assume he i in opposition to their answer.  Of\\ncourse, the Christian answer i that he agree  but i try to\\nmake some hidden point, to reveal some mystery about the divine\\nnature of the messiah-k   It\\' tempt to believe thi  if one\\ni a Christian and not interest in matter of investigation. \\nBut, there are problem \\n       In Jesu  time, the psalm wa thought to be about the\\nmessiah.  And, it i easy to see why David might refer to the\\nmessiah a hi superior.  We ne on look at the scripture about the messiah to see that he i expect to be a great k \\nbring the Jew to time even better than those under David\\' rule.  Of course, the Jew listen had no good answer, and the\\npassage could inde refer to a divine messiah, such a the\\nChristian worship.  The problem lie in the mean of thi psalm, an error that apparent several Jew of Jesu  time had\\nalso made.  One must remember that there were variou faction among the Jew  often a a result of different expectation of the\\nmessiah-k   Jesu wa apparent one of these adventist  like\\nhi audience, who thought the messiah\\' advent wa imminent, and\\nwho interpret Psalm 110, among other  a be messianic.\\nWhat i the problem, then?  Psalm 110 literal read \\n\\n       YHVH\\' utterance to my lord:\\n\\t\"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemie your\\n       footstool.\"\\n\\n       YHVH send forth your mighty scepter from Zion.  Rule\\n       in the midst of your foe   Your people will offer\\n       themselve free on the day you lead your host on the\\n       ho mountain   \\n\\n       \"You are a priest of the order of Melchizedek\\n       forever.\"\\n\\nThe word \"lord\" i often mistaken capitalis by Christian\\nbible to denote divinity in thi lord.  But, in the Hebrew, the\\nword i \"adoni,\" and no capitalisation exist   Adoni simp mean \"lord,\" a generic term a we would use it.  It i us often in\\nthe scripture to refer to king and to G\\'d.  It i mere an\\naddre of respect.  \\n      There i noth in the text itself to imp that the word\\nrefer either to divinity or to the messiah-k   That thi i suppos to be written by David i not certain.  The title of the\\npsalm translate to either \"a psalm of David,\" or \"a psalm about\\nDavid.\"  It seem fitt to assume it to be written by a court\\npoet, about David\\' covenant and endorsement from G\\'d.  If the\\npsalm had been written by David, it i unlike that he would be\\ntalk about the messiah.  The idea of a perfect k  descend from David, wa not present in David\\' age.  We have extensive\\ntale of David\\' doing and saying - none of which include any\\npraise of a messiah.\\n     Many of the psalm show evidence of be written long after\\nDavid wa dead, in time of the exile when G\\'d had put hi show of\\nfavour for David\\' kingdom on hold.  \\n     The description in the psalm fit David very well.  David wa promis by G\\'d a rise to power, victory over hi enemie \\nsuccessful judgement among the nation he conquer   He achiev the priesthood common to Melchizedek in be a righteou k \\nenabl to ble the people.   It all fit \\n      We do not have to blame thi problem on Matthew alone,\\nthough.  Here, there i not artificial prophecy allud to, though\\nhi use of the scripture i rather questionable.  Still, thi event i common to the other gospel too.  So, we let Matthew off\\na little more easi thi time.  It i interest to note,\\nthough, how Matthew dresse up the event.  The earlier gospel of\\nMark tell the tale with Jesu simp speak to a crowd. \\nMatthew ha the Pharisee  who became the religiou competition of\\nan infant Christianity, be the target of Jesu  question.  A we\\nmight expect, Matthew write that the event end up by\\nembarra the Pharisee   Such power i the pen.\\n\\nMose & Jesu \\nHad it Together\\nAll Along...:\\n\\n       We leave the gospel story of Matthew momentari to see a\\npseudo-prophecy in John\\' gospel.  The gospel story of John\\ndeserve special treatment, because it seem to be so far remov from the real event of Jesu  career a told by even Matthew. \\nBut, for the moment, we will just look at one verse.  The ear church leader found a religion on the Jewish hope of a messiah\\nk  and on an artificial extension of the original promise made\\nby G\\'d.  When construct the history of Abraham, Mose wrote of\\na promise of land and nationhood to the Jewish people.  While thi wa accomplish eventual  under the rule of k David, the\\nChristian who came along later decid that they would claim the\\nfulfillment of the promise.  But, to do so, they expand on the\\npromise, preach about a heaven kingdom.\\n\\n       [John 8.56] (J.C. speak  Your father, Abraham,\\n       rejoic to see My day.  He say it and wa glad.\\n\\nIt would be nice to tie in approval for Jesu from Abraham, but,\\nAbraham knew noth of Jesu or a messiah, or anyth Christian. \\nI have tri  and fail to find any event in the Old Testament\\nwhich correspond to John\\' little prophecy.  It i par for the\\ncourse to see St. John mak up Old Testament backing  just like\\nhi forerunner Matthew.  Many Christian know that their faith ha many of it foundation in such fraud, and it i surpri they\\nstill cl to it.\\n\\nThe Potter\\' Field:\\n\\n      We are told that Jesu wa betray while in Jerusalem by\\none of hi follower  Juda Iscariot.   Matthew write \\n\\n       [Mt 27.5-10]  And throw down the piece of silver\\n       in the temple, [Juda  depart .. But, the chief\\n       priest  tak the silver, said, \"It isn\\'t lawful for\\n       u to put it in the treasury, since it i blood\\n       money.\"  So they... bought a potter\\' field with it to\\n       bury stranger in... Then wa fulfill what wa        spoken by the prophet Jeremiah,\\n\\n       \"And they took the thirty piece of silver, the price\\n       of him on whom a price had been set by some of the\\n       son of Israel, and they gave them for the potter\\'        field, a the lord direct me.\"\\n\\nThi prophecy i an utter gro bastardisation of Old Testament\\nScripture.  First, Matthew ha made a mistake regard the name\\nof the prophet.  It i Zechariah who utter the verse which\\nMatthew make use of.\\n\\n       [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weigh out my wage \\n       thirty shekel of silver.  Then YHVH said to me, \"Cast\\n       them to the treasury,\" --the lord price at which I\\n       wa paid off by them.  So I took the thirty shekel of\\n       silver and cast them into the treasury in the house of\\n       YHVH.\\n\\nFirst of all, the verse of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer\\nof the messiah, or of G\\'d.  The deal with a shepherd, most like a priest, chosen to serve a function of presid over the people\\nshort before G\\'d would send Judah and Israel into conflict with\\none another.  The word, \"treasury,\" had been replac by the K Jame Scholar with \"to the potter,\" precise because thi made\\nMatthew\\' quote fit better.  But, thi i a blatant error.  The\\ncorrect translation of the Hebrew i inde \"treasury,\" which also\\nmake perfect sense in Zechariah\\' context, wherea \"potter\\' field\" i total unrelat   Whether the mistranslation wa intentional or not seem to be beyond speculation.  However, given\\nMatthew\\' track record, one find it hard to resist the notion of\\nintentional dishonesty.\\n      Of course, Matthew would have ample reason for alter the\\ntext.  The thirty piece of silver match Juda  situation, and if\\na most Christian seem to be, the reader i will to disregard\\nthe contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy to\\nto around.  However, the correct translation of Zechariah\\ndirect contradict the situation with Juda and the high\\npriest   The high priest would not put the money in the\\ntreasury.  The worthle shepherd of Zechariah doe exact the\\nopposite!  Of course, to the average Thursday-Night Bible student,\\nthe \"prophecy\" a present by Matthew would be taken at New\\nTestament face value.  To those, Matthew\\' work i convinc enough.\\n\\nWine, Vinegar,\\n& Cast Lot \\n\\n      Then, Jesu i l away to be crucifi \\n\\n       [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,\\n       mingl with gall; but when he tast it, he would not\\n       drink it.  And, when they had crucifi him, they\\n       divid hi garment among them by cast lot  that\\n       it might be fulfill what wa spoken by the prophet,\\n\\n       \"They part my garment among them, and upon my\\n       vesture did they cast lot \"\\n\\nFirst of all, the vinegar offer to Jesu i actual common sour\\nwine, of the type that Roman soldier drank regular   We find\\nthat right before Jesu die  the soldier themselve give him\\nsome to drink --not pollut with gall.\\n\\n       [Jn 19.28-30]  Jesu .. said, \"I thirst.\"  A bowl of\\n       vinegar stood there, so they put a sponge full of the\\n       vinegar on hyssop and held it to hi mouth.  When he\\n       had receiv the vinegar, he said, \"It i finish \"\\n\\nBut, Matthew seem to be draw on, not a passage from the\\nprophet  but one from the Psalm \\n\\n       [P 69.20-28]  I look for pity, but there wa none;\\n       and for comforter  but I found none.  They gave me\\n       poison for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and\\n       for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add\\n       to them punishment upon punishment, may they have no\\n       acquittal from thee.  Let them be blott out of the\\n       Book of the Liv \\n\\nOf course, the sour wine offer to Jesu i done at hi request\\nof drink.  Thi doe inde seem to be a show of pity.  The psalm\\nquot i about David and hi political and military enemie   It\\ni not about the messiah or Jesu   It i then not surpri that\\nwe run into further problem when we see that the \"Jesu  in the\\npsalm ask G\\'d for the damnation of the \"crucifier \" wherea the\\nJesu of the gospel say \\n\\n       [Lk 23.34]  Jesu said, \"Father, forgive them, the\\n       don\\'t know what they do!\"\\n\\nFurther, Matthew misse with hi attempt to create prophecy by\\nhav gall (a bitter substance) put into Jesu  drink, not hi meat, a the psalm stipulate \\n\\n       With the \"prophecy\" of the vinegar faulty, we natural ask, \"What of the cast of lot \"  Thi bring up the 22nd\\nPsalm, which deserve discussion all by itself.  Suffice it now to\\nsay that the fact that Jesu  clothe were divid a told i no\\ngreat th   It turn out that thi happen often to any felon\\nin those day   A we will soon see, it i perhap the least\\nerroneou passage of the psalm when appli to Jesu   It doe inde br up the interest question a to the quality of\\nJesu  clothe   For a man so remov from world possession \\nhi ownership of clothe worthy of cast lot raise some\\nsuspicion \\n\\nThe 22nd Psalm:\\n\\n      Thi psalm i attribut to David, a a lament of hi condition under the attack of hi enemie   It become a song of\\npraise to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, part of it\\nseem to fit the plight of Jesu at the crucifixion quite well.  We\\nwill examine the primary passage \\n\\n       Verse 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you forsaken me?! \\n       Why are you so far from help me, far from the word        of my groan   Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you\\n       don\\'t answer, and by night, but find no rest.\\n\\nJesu i said to have cri the first sentence while on the cro  \\nThi suggest that the whole psalm i real about Jesu  rather\\nthan k David.  Of course, the rest of the first stanza doe not\\nfit a nice to Jesu or hi execution.  Jesu i not pictur a complain about the whole ordeal, he i suppos to be like \"the\\nlamb l mute before it shearer \"  Inde  Jesu doesn\\'t do much\\ngroan  even when on the cro   He certain doe not cry by\\nboth day and night on the cro \\n\\n       6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man-- scorn by men... \\n       All who see me mock at me.  They make face and wag\\n       their head   \"He committ hi cause to YHVH.  So let\\n       him deliver him... for he delight in him.\"\\n\\nThi seem to fit Jesu  execution pretty well, with the\\nexception of the Ho messiah be call a worm.\\n\\n       12-13:  Many bull encompa me... they open their\\n       mouth wide at me like a raven and roar lion.\\n\\n       16-18:  Yea, dog are round about me, a company of\\n       evildoer encir-cle me, they have pierc my hand and\\n       feet.  I can see all my bone .. They divide my\\n       garment among them, and cast lost for my raiment.\\n\\n       19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my\\n       soul from the sword, my life from the power of the\\n       dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my\\n       afflict soul from the horn of the wild bull!\\n\\nIt would seem quite convinc  and I\\'m sure the ear Christian\\nfather who wrote of thi prophecy thought so too.  Unfortunate \\nthi prophecy ha a fatal flaw.  The word \"have pierc  real do not exist in the psalm.  The correct Hebrew translation i \\n\\n       16:  Yea, dog are round about me, a company of\\n       evildoer encircle me, like the lion, they are at my\\n       hand and feet...\\n\\nIn Hebrew the phrase \"like the lion\" and a very rare verb form\\nwhich can mean \"pierc  differ by one phonetic character.  The\\nword in the Hebrew text i literal  \"like the lion\" (ka\\'ari),\\nwhich make sense in the context, and even further fit the animal\\nimagery employ by the psalm writer.  It i convenience that\\nwould urge a Christian to change the word to \"ka\\'aru.\"   But, to\\nadd the need (yet artificial) weight to the \"prophecy\" thi i just what the Christian translator have chosen to do.  While the\\ncorrect translation doe not eliminate the psalm from referr to\\nJesu  it absence doe not say much for the honesty of the\\ntranslator \\n\\n       Apart from the erroneou verse 16, the psalm doe not lend\\nitself to Jesu so easi   Verse 20 speak of the sufferer be sav from a sword rather than a cro   Thi natural fit the\\npsalm\\' true subject, k David.  A a side note, we now know\\nthat crucifixion did not pierce the hand  the palm  but rather\\nthe forearm   Thi doesn\\'t say much in favour of the traditional\\nthought of a resurrect Jesu show hi disciple the scar on\\nhi palm   But then, fact aren\\'t bound by our religiou belief \\n\\n      Matthew escape culpability thi time, a he doe not\\nattempt to draw many direct link between thi psalm and hi lord\\nJesu   But the psalm, like many other  wa on the mind of all\\nthe gospel writer when they compil the storie and\\ninterpretation of Jesu  life and death.  How much these\\nscripture may have contribut to what actual got written down\\ni a question that ha seriou repercussion for Christian\\ntheology.  It i easy to see, for those who are not faithful\\nfundamentalist  how some of the event in the New Testament might\\nhave been \"enhanc  by scribe such a the eager Matthew.  But,\\nit doe le to speculate than to simp investigate scriptural\\nmatter and prophetic claim   So far, thi ha not said good\\nthing for St. Matthew.\\n\\nThe reference to the pierc look a lot like Jesu  crucifixion.  John\\' gospel recount, written about 70 year after\\nthe fact, tell u at Jesu  execution,\\n\\n       [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the soldier pierc hi        side with a spear, and out came blood and water...\\n       these thing took place that Scripture be fulfill ..\\n       \"The will look on him whom they\\'ve pierc \"\\n\\nOf course, thi i built on a passage taken blatant out of\\ncontext.   Prophet Zechariah tell u how much of the nation of\\nIsrael will split off from Jerusalem and Judah and go to war with\\nthem.\\n\\n       [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...\\n       And on that day, I will seek to destroy the nation        that come against Jerusalem (in Judah).  And I will\\n       pour a spirit of compassion and supplication... on\\n       Jerusalem so that when they look on him who they have\\n       pierc  they will mourn, and weep bitter over him\\n       like you weep over a firstborn child.\\n\\nJohn\\' attempt to make up prophecy i perhap weaker that\\nMatthew\\' attempt   Matthew, at least, usual excontext more\\nthan just one passage.  John\\' error are gro obviou and\\nblatant here.  It doe not speak well for any of the gospel\\nwriter  a it help to show how the prophetic aspect of their\\nreligion were found \\n\\n\\x0c\\nReckon with\\nTransgressor \\n\\n       After hi arrest, Jesu i quick execut for claim the Jewish kingship, messiahship.   Accord to one version of\\nthe gospel tale, Jesu get execut along with two thieve \\n\\n       [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucifi two robber \\n       one on hi right, one on hi left.  And so the\\n       scripture wa fulfill which say \\n\\n       \"He wa reckon with the transgressor \"\\n\\nHere, Mark i try to link Jesu to a passage in Isaiah 53,\\nabout the servant nation of Israel.  The passage i not about the\\nmessiah, for if one read the whole chapter of Isaiah 53, and it surround chapter  one see that the servant i a nation.  The\\nverse are also about what thi servant ha gone through in the\\npast, not a prediction of what i to come, in any event.  The\\nservant i thought of a a criminal.  Thi also happen to fit the\\ndescription of Jesu   Had the passage real been about the\\nmessiah, it still i not at all clear why execut Jesu between\\ntwo thieve would fulfill the \"prophecy\" in Isaiah.  Jesu would\\nmore fitting fulfill it with hi whole ministry.  He wa consider a blasphemer and troublemaker all throughout hi career.   Lock onto a single event i a rather poor way to\\nsteal prophecy, at least in thi case, a we see that Mark could\\nhave had made a better analogy with general comparison \\n\\n       Mark goe on to tell u how \"those who were crucifi with\\n[Jesu  also revil him.\" [15.32]  Thi i to be expect from a\\ncouple of robber   Of course in hi later recount, St. Luke\\ndecide to change some thing   Luke tell u \\n\\n       [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminal who wa hang        with him rail  \"Aren\\'t you the messiah?! Save\\n       yourself, and u \"\\n\\nThi certain fit with Mark\\' recount, which tell how the\\npeople who crucifi Jesu said, \"Save yourself!\" and that the\\nrobber did the same.  But then Luke goe on,\\n\\n       But the other [criminal] rebuk [the first] say \\n       \"Don\\'t you fear G\\'d, since you are under the same\\n       sentence of condemnation?  And we, inde just so,\\n       for we are receiv the due reward for our de  \\n       But, thi man ha done noth wrong. And he said,\\n       \"Jesu  remember me when you come in your kingdom.\" \\n       And Jesu answer  \"Veri I say to you, today you\\n       will be with me in paradise.\"\\n\\nNow, thi little dialogue seem high contriv   It stretche the imagination a bit to see thi picture of one ruffian rebuk hi fellow criminal with such eloquent speech.  We have a rather\\nstrange picture of a criminal lament over the goodne of hi punishment and the justne of hi suffer    Such a man,\\napparent noble and of principle, doesn\\'t seem like to have\\nbeen a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatric creat by\\nLuke.  Of course, Luke\\' recount also disagree with Mark\\'   \\nLuke ha on one criminal revile Jesu  not both.  It i easy\\nenough to discount the discrepancy because the account wa made\\nup, but those who wish to believe it i all part of the error free\\nword of G\\'d do not have thi avenue open.  Thi i yet another\\nexample of a writer try to take an Old Testament passage and\\nexpand it and reinterpret it to suit hi theology.  In thi case,\\nthe embroidery create some embarra problem  a we have\\nseen.\\n\\nThe End of the\\nWorld--\\n       Mt. 24:\\n\\n       Now come perhap one of the most extraordinary and\\nembarra passage in the New Testament.  It i found in all\\nthree of the synoptic gospel storie  and cast some of the most\\nunfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Christianity.  Jesu mention the destruction of the Jewish temple and building  and\\nhi disciple ask him about thi  and about the end of the world\\nwhich he ha been warn about.\\n\\n       The disciple  Tell u  when will thi [the temple\\'        destruction] be, and what will be the sign of your\\n       com  and of the close of the age?\\n\\n       Jesu  Take care that no one lead you astray, for\\n       many will come in my name, say  \"I am the christ.\"  \\n       ...you will hear of war and rumour of war .. for\\n       thi must take place, but the end i not yet.   For,\\n       nation will rise against nation... all thi i but the\\n       beginn of the birthpang \\n             They will deliver you up... put you to death,\\n       and false prophet will arise and lead many astray.\\n       ...But he who endure to the end will be sav   Thi        gospel will be preach throughout the whole world, a\\n       testimony to the nation  and then the end will come.\\n             So, when you see the desolation spoken of by the\\n       prophet Daniel, ...let those who are in Judea flee to\\n       the mountain \\n\\n             Immediate after the tribulation of those day \\n       the sun will be darken .. the star will fall from\\n       heaven... then will appear the sign of the Son of Man\\n       in heaven, and all the tribe of the earth will mourn,\\n       and see the Son of Man com .. and he will send out\\n       hi angel .. and gather hi elect...\\n             Learn the lesson of the fig tree: a soon a it        branch become tender and put forth leave  you know\\n       that summer i near.  So also, when you see all these\\n       thing  you will know that He i near, at the very\\n       gate.  Tru I say to you, thi generation will not\\n       pa away until all these thing take place...\\n             But, of the day and hour, no one know  not the\\n       angel  not the Son, but on the Father... Therefore,\\n       you also must be ready, for the Son of Man i com        at an hour you do not expect.\\n\\nFrom thi  it i clear that Jesu thought the world would in\\nwithin the lifetime of at least some of hi disciple   He tell them that although he doesn\\'t know the exact day or hour, that it\\nwill come, and thu they must be ready.  Theologian have wet\\ntheir pant in panic to find some way out of thi Ho Error. \\nBut, unfortunate  Jesu made himself to explicit.  He told hi disciple that their generation would still be around at the End,\\nand that they in particular should prepare for it, prepare to be\\nswept away.\\n      There have been some who resort to remov the inerrant\\nnature of the Bible, and said that the phrase, \"thi generation\\nshall not pa away...\" real mean \"thi race of people will not\\npa away...\"  Of course, the word for generation i us many\\ntime to refer to exact that, the generation of the disciple  \\nIt i an interest notion that when God decid to learn Greek,\\nhe didn\\'t learn it well enough to make himself clear.  But. it i quite obviou from the rest of the dialogue that the disciple (at\\nleast some of them) are suppos to live to the End of the World. \\nThe charge of mistranslation i complete blown away by look at the Apostle  response   It become abundant clear from\\nRev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Jesu meant exact what he said.  The End wa very near.\\n\\n       For 2,000 year  Christian have rationalis thi 24th\\nchapter of Matthew, or ignor it mean altogether.  For 2,000\\nyear  they have wait for their execut leader to come back,\\nhear of war  and rumour of war  sure that He i com soon. \\nSure He must be.  All we must do i wait.  Can you imagine how\\ntir He must be, sitt around up there, be ho  wait for\\njust the right moment to spr \\n\\n\\n       So, short after hi crucifixion, Jesu of Nazareth,\\n(Joshua-ben-Joseph), di    It i said that after three day  or\\nthree day and three night  or three period of time, or three\\neternal second --or three of whatever they can decide make for\\nle trouble-- he wa seen again, resurrect  glow with divine\\nradiance.  Then the Saviour decid it wasn\\'t in the best\\ninterest of hi new religion to stick around, and therefore\\ndisappear from sight into heaven.  So the story goe  anyway. \\nA ha been seen, there were many thing attribut to Jesu when\\npeople got around to writ the gospel storie down.  To them,\\nJesu wa the fulfiller of all prophecy and scripture.  We have\\nseen, though, that thi matter i quite shaky.  But, throughout\\nChurch history, Christian have held fast to faith, in simple\\nbelief.  What doctrinal objection could not be solv with\\nargumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulne kept away\\nfrom question.  To question and investigate ha never been the\\neasiest way to treat matter   Thu for 2,000 year  the\\nprophecie cit in the New Testament have gone on large accept   Thing may well continue that way for some time. \\nPau a moment to consider the way the doctrine of Christianity\\nhave been accept and us (proper or improper  to support\\nwar and persecution, I suppose there i one prophecy of which\\nChristianity can secure keep hold.', u'\\nCould be the (folk?) song \"Clementine\".

A he said himself:\\n\\n   The folkish-mind man, in particular, ha the sacr duty, each in\\n   hi own denomination, of mak _people_stop_just_talking_\\n   superficially_of_God\\'s_will,_and_actually_fulfill_God\\'s_will,_and_\\n   not_let_God\\'s_word_be_desecrat _[orig. ital.]\\n\\n   For God\\' will gave men their form, their essence, and their\\n   abilitie   Anyone who destroy Hi work i declar war on the\\n   Lord\\' creation, the divine will.  Therefore, let every man be\\n   active, each in hi own denomination if you please, and let every\\n   man take it a hi first and most sacr duty to oppose anyone who\\n   in hi activity by word or de step outside the confine of hi    religiou community and trie to butt into the other.\\n\\n   [...]\\n\\n   Hence today I believe that I am act in accordance with the will\\n   of the Almighty Creator: _by_defending_myself_against_the_Jew,_I_am_\\n   fighting_for_the_work_of_the_Lord._[orig. ital.]\\n\\n          -- Adolf Hitler, from \"Mein Kampf\", tran  Ralph Mannheim.\\n\\nOf course, someone bad believ someth doe not make that belief\\nwrong.  It\\' also entire possible that Hitler wa  when he claim \\nto believe in God.  We certain can\\'t conclude that he\\' an atheist, \\nthough.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: The Bible prove it\\n\\nTypical post \\n\\nIn the Bible it say that...\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nMost of the reader of alt.atheism feel that the Bible i of questionable\\naccuracy, a it wa written thousand of year ago by many author who were\\nrecord oral tradition that exist many year before.  Thu  any claim \\'truth\\' in it i of questionable legitimacy.  Thi isn\\'t to say that The\\nBible ha no truth in it; simp that any truth must be examin before be accept \\n\\nMany of the reader of thi group also feel that because any passage i subject to \"interpretation\", any claim that a passage \\'mean  one th and\\none th on i not legitimate.\\n\\nNote that thi feel tend to extend to other book \\n\\nIt i also remarkable to many atheist that theist tend to ignore other\\nequal plausible religiou book in favour of those of their own religion.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Pascal\\' Wager\\n\\nTypical post \\n\\nIf you believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you have lost noth --\\nbut if you don\\'t believe in God and turn out to be incorrect, you will go to\\nhell. Therefore it i foolish to be an atheist.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThi argument i known a Pascal\\' Wager.  It ha several flaw \\n\\nFirst  it doe not indicate which religion to follow.  Inde  there are\\nmany mutual exclusive and contradictory religion out there.  Thi i often\\ndescrib a the \"avoid the wrong hell\" problem.  If a person i a\\nfollower of religion X, he may end up in religion Y\\' version of hell.\\n\\nSecond  the statement that \"If you believe in God and turn out to be\\nincorrect, you have lost noth  i not true.  Suppose you\\'re believ in\\nthe wrong God -- the true God might punish you for your foolishne \\nConsider also the death that have result from people reject medicine in\\nfavour of prayer.\\n\\nAnother flaw in the argument i that it i bas on the assumption that \\nthe two possibilitie are equal like -- or at least, that they are of \\ncomparable likelihood.  If, in fact, the possibility of there be a God \\ni close to zero, the argument become much le persuasive.  So sad the\\nargument i on like to convince those who believe already.\\n\\nAlso, many feel that for intellectual honest people, belief i bas on \\nevidence, with some amount of intuition.  It i not a matter of will or \\ncost-benefit analysi \\n\\nFormal speak  the argument consist of four statement \\n\\n  1. One doe not know whether God exist \\n  2. Not believ in God i bad for one\\' eternal soul if God doe      exist.\\n  3. Believ in God i of no consequence if God doe not exist.\\n  4. Therefore it i in one\\' interest to believe in God.\\n\\nThere are two approache to the argument.  The first i to view 1 a an\\nassumption, and 2 a a consequence of it.  One problem with thi approach, in\\nthe abstract, i that it create information from no information.  Thi i consider invalid in information theory.  Statement 1 indicate one ha no\\ninformation about God -- but statement 2 indicate that beneficial information\\ncan be gain from the absolute lack of information about God.  Thi violate information entropy -- information ha been extract from no information, at\\nno \"cost\".\\n\\nThe alternative approach i to claim that 1 and 2 are both assumption   The\\nproblem with thi i that 2 i then basical an assumption which state the\\nChristian position, and on a Christian will agree with that assumption. The\\nargument thu collapse to \"If you are a Christian, it i in your interest to believe in God\" -- a rather vacuou tautology, and not the way Pascal\\nintend the argument to be view \\n\\nThe biggest reason why Pascal\\' wager i a failure i that if God i omniscient he will certain know who real believe and who believe a a wager.  He will spurn the latter... assum he actual care at all\\nwhether people believe in him.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: What i Occam\\' Razor?\\n\\nTypical post \\n\\nPeople keep talk about Occam\\' Razor.  What i it?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nWilliam of Occam formulat a principle which ha become known a Occam\\' \\nRazor.  In it original form, it said \"Do not multip entitie \\nunnecessari \"  That i  if you can explain someth without suppo the existence of some entity, then do so.\\n\\nNowaday when people refer to Occam\\' Razor, they general expre it \\nmore general  for example a \"Take the simplest solution\".\\n\\nThe relevance to atheism i that we can look at two possible explanation \\nfor what we see around u \\n\\n1. There i an incredib intricate and complex universe out there, which\\ncame into be a a result of natural processe \\n\\n2. There i an incredib intricate and complex universe out there, and \\nthere i also a God who creat the universe.  Clear thi God must be \\nof non-zero complexity.\\n\\nGiven that both explanation fit the fact  Occam\\' Razor might suggest \\nthat we should take the simpler of the two -- solution number one.\\nUnfortunate  some argue that there i a third even more simple solution:\\n\\n3. There isn\\'t an incredib intricate and complex universe out there.  \\nWe just imagine that there i \\n\\nThi third option lead u logical toward solipsism, which many people \\nfind unacceptable.\\n \\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Why it\\' good to believe in Jesu \\nTypical post \\n\\nI want to tell people about the virtue and benefit of my religion.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nPreach i not appreciat \\n\\nFeel free to talk about your religion, but please do not write posting that\\nare on a \"conversion\" theme.  Such posting do not belong on alt.atheism and\\nwill be reject from alt.atheism.moderat (try the newsgroup\\ntalk.religion.misc).\\n\\nYou would doubtle not welcome posting from atheist to your favourite\\nnewsgroup in an attempt to convert you; please do unto other a you would\\nhave them do unto you!\\n\\nOften theist make their basic claim about God in the form of lengthy\\nanalogie or parable   Be aware that atheist have heard of God and know the\\nbasic claim about him; if the sole purpose of your parable i to tell\\natheist that God exist and bring salvation, you may a well not post it,\\nsince it tell u noth we have not been told before.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Why I know that God exist \\nTypical post \\n\\nI *know* from personal experience and prayer that God exist \\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nJust a many theist have personal evidence that the be they worship\\nexist  so many atheist have personal evidence that such being do not\\nexist.  That evidence varie from person to person.\\n\\nFurthermore, without wish to dismi your evidence out of hand, many\\npeople have claim all kind of unlike thing -- that they have been\\nabduct by UFO  visit by the ghost of Elvi  and so on.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Einstein and \"God doe not play dice\"\\n\\nTypical post \\n\\nAlbert Einstein believ in God.  Do you think you\\'re cleverer than him?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nEinstein did once comment that \"God doe not play dice [with the universe]\". \\nThi quotation i common mention to show that Einstein believ in the\\nChristian God.  Us thi way, it i out of context; it refer to Einstein\\' refusal to accept the uncertaintie indicat by quantum theory. Furthermore,\\nEinstein\\' religiou background wa Jewish rather than Christian.\\n\\nA better quotation show what Einstein thought about God i the follow \\n\"I believe in Spinoza\\' God who reveal himself in the order harmony of\\nwhat exist  not in a God who concern himself with fate and action of\\nhuman being \"\\n\\nEinstein wa unable to accept Quantum Theory because of hi belief in an\\nobjective, order reality; a reality which would not be subject to random\\nevent and which would not be dependent upon the observer.  He believ that\\nQM wa incomplete, and that a better theory would have no ne for\\nstatistical interpretation   So far no such better theory ha been found,\\nand much evidence suggest that it never will be.\\n\\nA longer quote from Einstein appear in \"Science, Philosophy, and Religion, A\\nSymposium\", publish by the Conference on Science, Philosophy and Religion\\nin Their Relation to the Democratic Way of Life, Inc., New York, 1941.  In\\n\\n  \"The more a man i imbu with the order regularity of all event    the firmer become hi conviction that there i no room left by the side\\n   of thi order regularity for cause of a different nature.  For him\\n   neither the rule of human nor the rule of divine will exist a an\\n   independent cause of natural event   To be sure, the doctrine of a\\n   personal God interfer with natural event could never be\\n   *refut  [italic hi , in the real sense, by science, for thi    doctrine can alway take refuge in those domain in which scientific\\n   knowledge ha not yet been able to set foot.\\n\\n   But I am convinc that such behavior on the part of representative    of religion would not on be unworthy but also fatal.  For a doctrine\\n   which i to maintain itself not in clear light but on in the dark,\\n   will of necessity lose it effect on mankind, with incalculable harm\\n   to human progre   In their struggle for the ethical good, teacher    of religion must have the stature to give up the doctrine of a personal\\n   God, that i  give up that source of fear and hope which in the past\\n   plac such vast power in the hand of priest   In their labor they\\n   will have to avail themselve of those force which are capable\\n   of cultivat the Good, the True, and the Beautiful in humanity\\n   itself.  Thi i  to be sure, a more difficult but an incomparab    more worthy task...\"\\n\\n\\n  \"It wa  of course, a lie what you read about my religou conviction \\n   a lie which i be systematical repeat   I do not believe in a\\n   personal God and I have never deni thi but have express it clear \\n   If someth i in me which can be call religiou then it i the\\n   unbound admiration for the structure of the world so far a our\\n   science can reveal it.\"\\n\\nThe latter quote i from \"Albert Einstein: The Human Side\", edit by Helen \\nDuka and Banesh Hoffman, and publish by Princeton University Pre   \\nAlso from the same book:\\n\\n  \"I do not believe in immortality of the individual, and I consider ethic    to be an exclusive human concern with no superhuman authority behind \\n   it.\"\\n\\nOf course, the fact that Einstein chose not to believe in Christianity doe \\nnot in itself imp that Christianity i false.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Everyone worship someth \\nTypical post \\n\\nEveryone worship someth  whether it\\' money, power or God.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nIf that i true, everyone i a polytheist.  Theist care just a much about\\nthose thing that atheist care about.  If the atheist  reaction to (for\\nexample) their familie amount to worship then so do the theist .\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Why there must be a causele cause\\n\\nTypical post \\n\\nSet of integer that have a lower bound each have a smallest member, so\\nchain of cause must all have a first element, a causele cause.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThe set of real number greater than zero ha a definite lower bound, but ha no smallest member.\\n\\nFurther, even if it i true that there must be a causele cause, that doe not imp that that cause must be a consciou supernatural entity, and\\nespecial not that any such entity must match the description favour by\\nany particular religion.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: The universe i so complex it must have been design \\nTypical post \\n\\nThe presence of design in the universe prove there i a God.  Sure you\\ndon\\'t think all thi appear here just by chance?\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThi i known a the Argument From Design.\\n\\nIt i a matter of dispute whether there i any element of design in the\\nuniverse. Those who believe that the complexity and diversity of liv creature on the earth i evidence of a creator are best advis to read the\\nnewsgroup talk.origin for a while.\\n\\nThere i insufficient space to summarize both side of that debate here.\\nHowever, the conclusion i that there i no scientific evidence in favour of\\nso-call Scientific Creationism. Furthermore, there i much evidence,\\nobservation and theory that can explain many of the complexitie of the\\nuniverse and life on earth.\\n\\nThe origin of the Argument by Design i a feel that the existence of\\nsometh a incredib intricate a  say, a human i so improbable that\\nsure it can\\'t have come about by chance; that sure there must be some \\nexternal intelligence direct thing so that human come from the chao deliberate \\n\\nBut if human intelligence i so improbable, sure the existence of a mind\\ncapable of fashion an entire universe complete with consciou being must\\nbe immeasurab more unlike   The approach us to argue in favour of the\\nexistence of a creator can be turn around and appli to the Creationist\\nposition.\\n\\nThi lead u to the familiar theme of \"If a creator creat the universe,\\nwhat creat the creator?\", but with the addition of spirall \\nimprobability.  The on way out i to declare that the creator wa not\\ncreat and just \"i  (or \"wa ).\\n\\nFrom here we might a well ask what i wrong with say that the universe\\njust \"i  without introduc a creator?  Inde Stephen Hawk  in hi book\\n\"A Brief History of Time\", explain hi theory that the universe i clos and finite in extent, with no beginn or end.\\n\\nThe Argument From Design i often stat by analogy, in the so-call \\nWatchmaker Argument.  One i ask to imagine that one ha found a watch on\\nthe beach.  Doe one assume that it wa creat by a watchmaker, or that it\\nevolv natural   Of course one assume a watchmaker.  Yet like the \\nwatch, the universe i intricate and complex; so, the argument goe  the \\nuniverse too must have a creator.\\n\\nThe Watchmaker analogy suffer from three particular flaw  over and above \\nthose common to all Argument By Design.  First  a watchmaker create \\nwatche from pre-exist material  wherea God i claim to have \\ncreat the universe from noth   These two sort of creation are \\nclear fundamental different, and the analogy i therefore rather weak.\\n\\nSecond  a watchmaker make watche  but there are many other thing in \\nthe world.  If we walk further along the beach and found a nuclear \\nreactor, we wouldn\\'t assume it wa creat by the watchmaker.  The argument \\nwould therefore suggest a multitude of creator  each responsible for a \\ndifferent part of creation.\\n\\nFinal  in the first part of the watchmaker argument we conclude that \\nthe watch i not part of nature because it i order  and therefore \\nstand out from the randomne of nature.  Yet in the second part of the \\nargument, we start from the position that the universe i obviou not \\nrandom, but show element of order.  The Watchmaker argument i thu \\ninternal inconsistent.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Independent evidence that the Bible i true\\n\\nTypical post \\n\\nThe event of the New Testament are confirm by independent documentary\\nevidence.  For example...\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThe writing of Josephu are often mention a independent documentary\\nevidence.\\n\\nEar version of Josephu  work are thought not to have mention Jesu or\\nJame  the extant version discusse John in a non-Christian context.  Many\\nscholar believe that the original mention Jesu and Jame in pa  but\\nthat thi wa expand by Christian copyist   Several \"reconstruction  of\\nthe original text have been publish to thi effect.\\n\\nMuch information appear in the Ecclesiastical History of Eusebiu (about 320\\nC.E.).  It i worthle a historical material because of the deliberate\\nfalsification of the wi Eusebiu who i general acknowledg a \\'the\\nfirst thorough dishonest historian of antiquity.\\' It i Eusebiu who i general given the title of authorship for thi material.\\n\\nAside from the New Testament, the biographical information about Jesu i more well-document   For further information, please consult the Frequent Ask Question file for the newsgroup soc.religion.christian.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: Godel\\' Incompletene Theorem\\n\\nTypical post \\n\\nGodel\\' Incompletene Theorem demonstrate that it i impossible for the\\nBible to be both true and complete.\\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nGodel\\' First Incompletene Theorem say that in any consistent formal \\nsystem which i sufficient expressive that it can model ordinary \\narithmetic, one can formulate expression which can never be proven to be \\nvalid or invalid (\\'true\\' or \\'false\\') within that formal system.  (Technical speak  the system must also be recursive; that i  there must be a decision\\nprocedure for determin whether a given str i an axiom within the formal \\nsystem.)\\n\\nEssential  all such system can formulate what i known a a \"Liar \\nParadox.\"  The classic Liar Paradox sentence in ordinary English i \"Thi \\nsentence i false.\"  Note that if a proposition i undecidable, the formal \\nsystem cannot even deduce that it i undecidable.\\n\\nThe logic us in theological discussion i rare well defin  so claim that Godel\\' Incompletene Theorem demonstrate that it i impossible to\\nprove or disprove) the existence of God are worthle in isolation.\\n\\nOne can trivial define a formal system in which it i possible to prove the\\nexistence of God, simp by hav the existence of God stat a an axiom. \\nThi i unlike to be view by atheist a a convinc proof, however.\\n\\nIt may be possible to succe in produc a formal system built on axiom that both atheist and theist agree with.  It may then be possible to show\\nthat Godel\\' Incompletene Theorem hold for that system.  However, that\\nwould still not demonstrate that it i impossible to prove that God exist within the system.  Furthermore, it certain wouldn\\'t tell u anyth about\\nwhether it i possible to prove the existence of God general \\n\\nNote also that all of these hypothetical formal system tell u noth about\\nthe actual existence of God; the formal system are just abstraction \\n\\nAnother frequent claim i that Godel\\' Incompletene Theorem demonstrate that a religiou text (the Bible, the Book of Mormon or whatever) cannot be\\nboth consistent and universal applicable. Religiou text are not formal\\nsystem  so such claim are nonsense.\\n\\n------------------------------\\n\\nSubject: George Bush on atheism and patriotism\\n\\nTypical post \\n\\nDid George Bush real say that atheist should not be consider citizen \\n\\nResponse:\\n\\nThe follow exchange took place at the Chicago airport between Robert I.\\nSherman of American Atheist Pre and George Bush, on August 27 1988.

It wa recent discover that the Arabic version of the treaty not on lack the\\nquotation, it lack Article XI altogether.\\n\\nThe person who translat the Arabic to English wa Joel Barlow, Consul\\nGeneral at Algier  a close friend of Thoma Paine -- and an opponent of\\nChristianity.  It i possible that Barlow made up Article XI, but since there\\ni no Arabic version of that article to be found, it\\' hard to say.\\n\\nIn 1806 a new Treaty of Tripoli wa ratifi which no longer contain the\\nquotation.\\n', u'\\nThi wa known a *Journey to the Far Side of the Sun* in the Unit State and a *Doppelganger* in the U.K.  It wa produc by the great\\nteam of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson (whose science wa usual a bit\\nbetter than thi .  It may have been their first production u live\\nactor - they were better known for their technophilic puppet show \\nsuch a *Supercar*, *Stingray*, and *Thunderbird .  Later, they went\\non to do more live-action SF serie  *UFO* and *Space: 1999*.\\n\\nThe astronomy wa lousy, but the lift body spacecraft, VTOL\\nairliner  and mighty Portugese launch complex were *wonderful* to\\nlook at.', u\"SSF i up for redesign again.  Let' do it right thi time!  Let' step back and consider the functionality we want:\\n\\n[1] microgravity/vacuum proce research\\n[2] life science research (adaptation to space)\\n[3] spacecraft maintenence \\n\\nThe old NASA approach, explifi by Shuttle and SSF so far, wa to\\ncentralize functionality.  These project fail to meet\\ntheir target by a wide margin: the military and commercial user \\ntook most of their payload off Shuttle after wast much effort to \\ntie their payload to it, and SSF ha crumbl into disorganization\\nand miscommunication.  Over $50 billion ha been spent on these\\ntwo project with no reduction in launch cost and littel improvement\\nin commercial space industrialization.  Meanwhile, military and commercial \\nuser have come up with a superior strategy for space development: the \\nconstellation.  \\n\\nFirst  different function are broken down into different \\nconstellation plac in the optimal orbit for each function:\\nthu we have the GP Navstar constellation in 12-hour orbit \\ncomsat in Clarke and Molniya orbit  etc.  Second  the task\\ni distribut amongst several spacecraft in a constellation,\\nprovid for redundancy and full coverage where need \\n\\nSSF' 3 main function require quite different environment and are also prime candidate for constellization.\\n\\n[1] We have the making of a microgravity constellation now:\\nCOMET and Mir for long-duration flight  Shuttle/Spacelab for\\nshort-duration flight   The best strategy for thi area i inexpensive, incremental improvement: installation of U.  facilitie \\non Mir, Shuttle/Mir linkup, and transition from Shuttle/Spacelab\\nto a much le expensive SSTO/Spacehab/COMET or SSTO/SIF/COMET.\\nWe might also expand the research program to take advantage of \\ninterest space environment  eg the high-radiation Van Allen belt \\nor ga plasma gradient in comet tail   The COMET system can\\nbe much more easi retrofitt for these task  where a \\nstation i too large to affordab launch beyond LEO.\\n\\n[2] We ne to study life science not just in microgravity,\\nbut also in lunar and Martian gravitie  and in the radiation\\nenvironment of deep space instead of the protect shelter\\nof LEO.  Thi i a very long-term, low-priority project, since\\nastronaut will have little practical use in the space program\\nuntil cost come down order of magnitude.  Furthermore, u astronaut severe restrict the scope of the investigation,\\nand the sample size.  So I propose LabRatSat, a constellation\\ntether-bolo satellite that test out variou level of gravity\\nin super-Van-Allen-Belt orbit that are representative of the\\nradiation environment encounter on Earth-Moon, Earth-Mar \\nEarth-asteroid, etc. trip   The miniaturiz life support\\nmachinery might be operat real-time from earth thru a VR\\ninterface.  AFter several orbital mission have been flown,\\nfollow-on can act a LDEF on the lunar and Martian surface,\\ntest out the actual environment at low cost before $billion are spent on astronaut \\n\\n[3] By far the largest market for spacecraft servic i in \\nClarke orbit.  I propose a fleet of small teleoperat robot and small test satellite on which ground engineer can\\npractice their skill   Once in place, robot can pry stuck\\nsolar array and antenna  attach solar battery power pack \\ninject fuel, etc.  Once the fleet i work  it can be\\nspun off to commercial company(  who can work with the comsat\\ncompanie to develop comsat replaceable module standard \\n\\nBy app the successful constellation strategy, and gett rid of the fail centraliz strategy of ST and old SSF, we\\nhave radical improv the capability of the program while\\ngreat cutt it cost.  For a fraction of SSF' pricetag,\\nwe can fix satellite where the satellite are, we can study\\nlife' adaptation to a much large & more representative variety \\nof space environment  and we can do microgravity and vacuum\\nresearch inexpensive and, if need  in special-purpose\\norbit \\n\\nN.B., we can app the constellation strategy to space exploration\\na well, great cutt it cost and increa it functionality.  \\nMar Network and Artemi are two good example of thi  more ambitiou \\nwe can set up a network of native propellant plant on Mar that can be us to fuel planet-wide rover/ballistic hopper prospect and\\nsample return.  The descendant of LabRatSat' technology can\\nbe us a a Mar surface LDEF and to test out clos ecology\\ngreenhouse on Mar at low cost.\\n\\n\", u': Exodu 21:22-25:\\n\\n:        22 And if men struggle with each other and strike a woman with\\n:           child so that she ha a miscarriage, yet there i no further\\n:           injury, he shall sure be fin a the woman\\' husband may\\n:           demand of him; and he shall pay a the judge decide.\\n:        23 But if there i any further injury, then you shall appoint\\n:           a a penalty life for life,\\n:        24 eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot,\\n:        25 burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.\\n\\n: The most straightforward interpretation of these verse i that if\\n: men in a fight strike a woman and cause her to miscarry, the penalty\\n: i on a fine.

I think the large Landsat and SPOT satellite \\nsystem will provide the majority of the satellite remote sen \\ndata market for the next decade or so.  In contrast to these large, \\ngovernment-sponsor remote sen system  smaller market venture \\nsuch a WorldView and other can exploit market niche and use \\ninnovative technology, and I believe, can find profitability on the \\nmargin.

Thi i bas upon GD\\' projection of \\ncaptur about 10 Atla launche per year on the world market. \\n   [Commentary:  Three failure in a row of their launch system ha \\nhurt General Dynamic\\' Space System Division.  Since GD ha \\nrestructur to on keep a very few profitable core businesse  \\nmany market pundit have been speculat GD\\' space busine might \\nbe next to be sold.  The Morgan Stanley report indicate GD\\' Space \\nSystem Division ha some potential a a moneymaker, despite current \\nproblem -- if they can get their act together.  Sale are project \\nto be about $560 M in 1993, which will probab generate a lo of \\nabout $25 M.  If GD can capture their project share of the space \\nlaunch market, and if they have manag to clean up the reliability \\nof their Atla launcher  then they could generate healthy profit \\nfrom those sale   But until they demonstrate the Atla Centaur \\nprogram i back on track, thi division will continue to show \\nsubstantial losse  \\n   In response to the sell-off rumor  in my opinion, thi operation \\ni not a real good candidate for takeover and quick profitability.  \\nTo do such a takeover, the current set corporate and divisional \\nmanagement would be replac with another set from outside the firm.  \\nIn GD SSD\\' case, to get the division back on track, the management \\nteam will have to concentrate hard on the technical problem with \\nthe Atla Centaur, a well a in sell Atla service   Thi would \\nindicate on another firm with experience in rocket launch \\noperation could find such talent in-house, and be able to convince \\ncustomer to buy their launch service   Optimal  the firm would \\nhave substantial liquid rocket experience, and experience in \\nmarket space technology international a well.  Candidate for \\nthi might be TRW, Rockwell, Lockhe  and Martin, and possib \\nMcDonnell Dougla and Boe   But most of those firm have cash \\nflow problem (MDC), have had a substantial busine contraction \\n(Boe and MDC), are involv with other launch firm (Lockhe , \\nor have taken on substantial debt (Martin).

Of 54 \\ninternational and commercial launche plann through 1995, Ariane \\nhold contract for 31, General Dynamic  Atla vehicle hold 14 \\ncontract  McDonnell Dougla  Delta hold 7, and Great Wall\\' Long \\nMarch vehicle hold 2 launch contract  \\n   Three-quarter of future launch contract for which Ariane can \\ncompete are project to come from communication satellite with \\nthe remain 25% split between weather, Earth observation, and \\nscientific satellite   Most of the future telecommunication demand \\ngrowth i predict to come from the Asia/Pacific region. \\n   Arianespace expect the current market consolidation of \\nindividual satellite operator into regional or national group will \\ncontinue, with these group invest in heavier satellite with \\nlarger communication payload carry more transponder  \\nArianespace predict the average ma of telecommunication \\nsatellite should increase by 20 % over today\\' average level, to \\nabout 3000 kg in GEO. \\n   Demand for commercial launch service i expect to remain \\nstrong over the next three year  but in the second half of the \\ndecade, Arianespace predict demand will decrease.  Arianespace \\nbase thi prediction upon a match of satellite transponder \\ndemand and supp   particular a new data compression technique \\nappear to could double or triple transponder capacity u exist \\nor near-term transponder  \\n   One of the significant possible change in the market wa \\nidentifi a the arrival of new launch vehicle  includ Russian \\nlaunch system   But Arianespace predict that in the long term, \\ninvestor purcha launch service are look for the best trade \\noff between launch service quality and price, and that Russian and \\nother new launch service will have to prove out their capabilitie \\nand service quality, and their market penetration will be minimal. \\n   [Commentary:  Ariane release their market survey annual  and \\nI report on their prior market survey in a past issue of CSN/STI.  \\nCompar the two survey  there aren\\'t outstand difference in \\nthe number    The most notable change i the consideration of new \\ndata compression technique  reduc the demand for new physical \\ntransponder on orbit.\\n   I note that in contrast to some prediction  demand for space-\\nbas communication transponder appear to be remain strong. While \\nfiber optic line are mak substantial inroad into the \\nestablish point-to-point telecommunication market  grow \\ndemand for telecommunication service world wide and for point-to-\\nmultipoint broadcast service have prevent a decrease in space \\ntransponder demand.  Fiberoptic cable provide a higher capability \\nservice, but on from establish point A to establish point B. \\nTo establish a fiberoptic link it i necessary to install cable \\nbetween the point  and while there are improv network solution  \\ninstall a large network of distribut fiberoptic link can cost \\nmillion or billion of dollar   \\n   For broadcast service where there i not an exist ground \\nnetwork structure, satellite still offer the most cost effective \\nsolution.  And if new service are requir into a new region, it i \\ncheaper to install a small satellite link cost on a few ten of \\nthousand of dollar and tie into the exist global satellite \\nnetwork.  Thi allow rapid growth of new satellite service  and \\nha kept demand high.  The replacement market for fiberoptic i \\ngrow a well, since a demand grow between the point servic  \\nit become cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to \\nhandle the increase in traffic. \\n   Since the telecommunication and data transfer market are still \\ngrow rapid  satellite market projection remain rosy.  But \\nsatellite are also gett longer orbital lifetime   Current \\ngeneration satellite are now gett guarantee of at 15 year of \\non-orbit service or more, in contrast to 10 year of service from \\nlast generation\\' satellite   Thi ha cut back some of the launch \\ndemand, a satellite owner are reschedul replacement satellite \\nlaunche over longer interval  \\n   And a last note; Arianespace didn\\'t flag it thi year, but it \\nlook like the space transportation market will be rather over-\\nsuppli by exist launch system in the near term.  The annual \\ncommercial launch demand i for about 15-20 medium siz satellite \\nper year.  From the supp side, Ariane i capable of launch up \\nto about a dozen medium siz satellite a year, Delta i capable of \\nabout 9-12 per year, Atla i capable of 6-12, Long March 4-8, \\nJapan\\' H-Vehicle 2-4, Russia\\' Proton capable of 8, and other \\nsystem such a Zenit and Soyuz another 10-20 medium launche per \\nyear.

Thi \\ninvestigation mark the first time NTSB ha taken the lead on an \\nincident involv a space launch.  Accord to the NTSB, their \\ninvestigation will take about 6 month  and i primari look at \\nline of authority, communication link and safety procedure us \\nin the launch. \\n  [Commentary: Thi i the first time that the NTSB ha l an \\ninvestigation into a space launch.  Their leadership wa request \\nby the Department of Commerce\\' Office of Commercial Space \\nTransportation, who had licens the commercial launch.  \\n   At the time of writ thi column, some of the initial \\ninvestigation have been conclud  and some of the result are \\nstart to leak out into the trade pre   Apparent  3 or four \\ndifferent communication channel were in use dur the test. After \\nthe abort destruct receiver stopp respond  the NASA test \\ndirector and range controller in the Mission Control room at Wallop \\nIsland gave abort order about a minute before the launch.  \\nAccord to the mission rule  thi should have stopp the launch. \\nSomehow, the OSC test conductor order the abort revers  and the \\nNASA communicator on the net relay that order to the B-52 carry \\nthe Pegasu at about 22 second before launch.

The preliminary \\nstudy recommend the site not be pursu a a commercial launch \\nsite, stat reopen the site wa not feasible due to project \\nlow investment return  plu environmental and other geographic \\nconsideration   However, the report did say the site might be ideal \\nfor other aerospace use  and recommend other potential use  \\n   [Commentary:  Thi should put the nail in the coffin of the \\nKingsland Commercial Launch Site.  While other site are still \\nproce with commercial launch site development plan  Kingsland \\nfound without a key customer to act a anchor tenant, and if \\nsubstantial infrastructure had to be put in, then the expect \\nreturn were too low to justify the cost of development.  \\n   Thi might point out some key discriminator in judg the \\nfeasibility of a commercial launch site.  These include:\\n  - I there an identifi key customer to provide core usage \\nsufficient to recover setup cost \\n  - I there a market advantage of u the site?\\n  - Can exist infrastructure be us or modifi at the site?\\n  - Can financ be found at low enough cost to support the \\ninvestment?  \\n   Other commercial launch site venture -- includ those at \\nWoomera, Poker Flat, Cape York, White Sand  Alabama Off-Shore \\nPlatform, Hawaii, and Vandenberg have to also be judg against \\nthese criteria.  In my opinion, some of these venture are f \\non hope and speculation, and not on sound financial ground ]\\n\\n9- SPAIN\\' CAPRICORNIA LAUNCHER STILL PROCE    In one of hi last official act  former President Bush \\nauthoriz space technology transfer for several joint space \\nventure between U and other firm   One of these wa a propos \\nuse of U technology by Spain to build a small booster.

A director of FREE\\nINDE  a national ex-gay ministry, Caligiuri wa singl out for offer discontent gay and lesbian \"a way out of the homosexual death-style\"\\nthrough prayer.  \"I\\'d like to give the award back,\" Caligiuri now laugh  \"I\\'m\\nno longer deserve it.\"\\n  Caligiuri\\' eight year involvement with the national \"ex-gay\" movement peak with hi found of the Phoenix chapter of Homosexual Anonymou (HA) a well\\na Free Inde   He ha since abandon hi pulpit and now say that the ex-\\ngay movement i a fruitle effort bas on deception.  \"There\\' no reality\\nin it,\" he say  \"I wa sell a product, and my product wa a lie.\"\\n  Head up by national ministrie like Exodu International and Courage, the\\norganization of the ex-gay movement re on the tenent of born-again\\nChristianity to convince disatisfi homosexual -- usual young gay men who\\nare just com out -- that they can sh their sexuality by suppre their\\nsexual urge and embrac Christianity.  \"We offer support to people who are\\nseek to leave the sin of homosexuality,\" explain Bob Davie  director of\\nExodu   He venture that \"about 80% of those seek to abandon their homo-\\nsexuality are men.\"\\n  \"Anybody who i involv in the ex-gay ministry i misguid and i wast their time,\" say Lisa Seeley, a former \"redeem lesbian\" who work with\\nCaligiuri a HA and appear with him on the Sal Jessy Raphael show.  \"These\\norganization are for people who are spiritual and emotional wound \"\\n  \"It\\' possible to change your identity or your behavior,\" say sex educator\\nBrian McNaught, author of _On Be Gay_. \"But it\\' real impossible to\\nchange your orientation.  These people are no longer call themselve gay,\\nbut they continue to have same-sex erotic feeling \"\\n  Caligiuri say he found Free Inde after an ominou week in 1981 when all\\nhell broke loose in hi personal life.  A few day after hi lover end both\\ntheir romance and their busine partnership, Caligiuri wa sexual assault by a man he pick up in a bar.  \"I wa real drunk,\" he recall  \"and I\\nwent home with thi guy.  He ti me up and rap me.  He left me ti up all\\nnight, and the next morn he rap me again.\"\\n  When Caligiuri wa eventual fre by the attacker, he return home to the\\nhome he shar with hi ex-lover.  \"He had another man there with him,\"\\nCaligiuri recall   \"I thought at thi time, \\'If thi i what be gay i about, I don\\'t want to be thi way anymore.\"\\n  Caligiuri vow that if he could find a way out, he would share hi discovery\\nwith other   He organiz an antigay contingent to demonstrate at Phoenix\\' gay pride parade in June 1985, and a few month later Free Inde held it first public protest.  At a meet to promote a gay civil right ordinance,\\nFree Inde member loud blast gay  tell them ther were sinner head for hell.\\n  Free Inde began receiv about a hundr telephone call a week, thank in part to a deceptive list in the local yellow page   \"We were list under Lesbian and Gay Alternative Service \" Caligiuri say  \"so people\\nthought we were a gay information switchboard.  People would call to find out\\nwhere the local bar were, and we\\'d preach to them about the sin of homo-\\nsexuality.\"  Ruse like thi are typical of the movement, Caligiuri say \\nadd  \"They\\'ll do anyth to reach these people.\"\\n  \"David us to go on radio and say real stupid thing \" recall Peter\\nKel  a counselor at Phoenix\\' Catholic diocese AID program, \"like that\\nhe knew he wa gay when he start wear pastel color \"\\n  Caligiuri\\' fami first found out about hi ministry when they saw him on\\nRaphael\\' syndicat talk show in 1985.  \"They were reliev \" he recall \\n\"They figur that if they had to have a gay person in the fami  better\\nthat I should be a \\'reform  gay person.\"\\n  But Caligiuri wa hard reform   \"By the time I appear on Sal  show,\" \"I\\'d start hav sex with men again.  Men would call our hotline\\nand tell me about thier latest sin: sex with their pastor, sex with their\\nfather.  I wa horny all the time.\"\\n  Unable to risk go to gay bar  where he might be recogniz from hi numerou television appearance  Caligiuri say he \"us to go to bookstore and get blowjob \"  When he wasn\\'t work the bookstore  he wa sleep with other \"reform  homosexual \\n  \"I didn\\'t realize it at first, but a lot of the HA leader were hav sex\\nwith one another,\" Caligiuri say   \"We\\'d go to conference in other citie \\nand we\\'d be pair up in hotel room   Everybody wa sleep with everybody\\nelse.\"\\n  By the time he appear on \\'AM Philadelphia\\' television show in May 1988,\\nCaligiuri wa hav anonymou sex a couple time a week.  When the show\\' host ask him if he ever \"act on temptation,\" hi answer wa a lie.\\n  Caligiuri\\' duplicity began to take it\\' toll on him, however.  He wa suffer from chrinic fatigue syndrome and candidiasi  a dibilitat yeast infection, and thi l to hi escape from the sect.  \"I wa too sick\\nto go to church,\" he explain   \"The more time I spent away from those people\\nthe more I began to feel like myself.  I began to remember who I us to be.\"\\n  Late in 1991, Caligiuri turn Free Inde phone line over to a local\\nchurch and clos the ministry\\' door   \"I\\'d convinc myself that there\\ni no ne in the world for ex-gay people,\" he say \\n  Today, Caligiuri, 31, i study alternative spiritualitie (\"I\\'m interest-\\n in belief system that aren\\'t judgemental.\"), consider romance (\"But\\nnot with a CHristian!\"), and search for a new project to devote himself to.\\n\"I feel compell to commit myself to gay cause \" he say   \"I want to\\neventual stop feel guilty about what I did and make up for the damage I\\nmay have brought to our community.\"\\n\\n---end article---\\n\\nCaligiuri\\' tory i by no mean unique and I have read several other article of former leader and founder of \\'ex-gay\\' ministrie who have said very similar th\\nsimilar thing   Fortuante not all of them have left Christianity, but have\\ncome to realize that God love them despite the attitude of other   Some,\\nlike Chri Glaser, director of the Presbyterian \"Lazaru Project\" of West\\nHollywood Presbyterian Church have actual been work with the gay community\\nto br them into the sheepfold of Christ and encourag real ethical value of sexuality within the sphere of be gay.  I have also, a I said talk and become\\nand become close friend with many who once attend such group a \"Love In\\nAction\" and other  who either once claim to have been \"reform  or who\\nwere too honest with themselve to live a lie, no matter who wa disappoint in them.  Some were even encourag to marry a a way of \"seal  their\\nnew heterosexuality, on to eventual start hitt the bar  bathhouse and bookstore  since these were usual activitie under the concealment of\\nnight and one-night-stand of promiscuou behavior meant no continuou \"sin\"\\nthrough a committ relationship.  Thi i a horrible trap which the CHurch\\nha dump on the back of the tru gay orient people, and the very inno-\\ncent victim in these case are the wive and children of such marriage   Yet\\nthe church insist that there are on two option they are will to allow\\ngay people: 1) heterosexuality or 2) celebacy.  Thi i sad.  What i also\\nmrtify  i in the case of those who cannot suppre their desire and\\nfear for thier sanity in such a mix up confusion that the church force on\\nthem, they may even opt for \\'suicide\\' or surgical damper of the brain\\nfunction   In the past lobotomie and heavey drug suppressant were common-\\nplace.  There are now becom available more and more literature on the\\nthreat of coercive Christianity toward gay  such a Sylvia Pennington\\' _\"Ex-Gay   There Are None_. and other   There are also a great many fact\\nbas book be written to help people trapp in thi confusion such a Maury Johnston\\' _Gay Under Grace_, and Chri Glaser\\' _Come Hom!_.

The software i available in version for M DO  Unix\\n  workstation (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VM  and quite possib   other platform by now.  I use the VM version.\\n\\n  The \"PCI software\" consist of several classe group package of\\n  utilitie  group by function but all operat on a common \"PCI\\n  database\" disk file.  The \"Tape I/O\" package i a set of utility\\n  program which read from the variou remote-sen industry tape\\n  format INTO, or write those format out FROM, the \"PCI database\" file;\\n  thi i the on package I use or know much about.  Other package can\\n  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several\\n  PCI-support third-party color display  output numeric or bitmap\\n  representation of image data to an attach printer, e.g. an Epson-type\\n  dot-matrix graphic printer.  You might be more spe- cifical   interest in the mathematical operation package: histo- gram and\\n  Fourier analysi  equalization, user-specifi operation (e.g.\\n  \"multip channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store a channel 5\"), and\\n  God on know what all else -- there\\' a LOT.  I don\\'t have and don\\'t\\n  use these, so can\\'t say much about them; you on buy the package your\\n  particular application/interest call for.\\n\\n  Each utility i controll by from one to eight \"parameter \" read from\\n  a common \"parameter file\" which must be (in VM anyway) in your \"default\\n  directory.\"  Some utilitie will share parameter and use the same\\n  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confu sett   up a serie of operation   The standard PCI environment contain a\\n  script language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allow you to\\n  automate the proce of sett up parameter for a common, complicat \\n  lengthy or difficult serie of utility execution   (In VM I can also\\n  invoke utilitie independent from a DCL command procedure.)  There\\'   also an optional programm library which allow you to write compil   language program which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI\\n  data structure (database file, parameter file).\\n\\n  The PCI software i design specifical for remote-sen image  but\\n  require such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the\\n  level where you can handle r- image  you can figure out way to handle\\n  a few other thing a well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offer a\\n  utility for read headerle multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the\\n  Macintosh call \"raw\") data from tape, in a number of different\\n  \"interleave\" order  Thi turn out to be ideal for manipulat the\\n  graphic-art industry\\' \"CT2T\" format, would probab (I haven\\'t tri \\n  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT\\n  YOU\\'RE DO or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start\\n  over.  It\\' worth not that the PCI \"database\" file i design to\\n  contain not on \"raster\" (image) data, but vector (for overlay map\\n  information enter via digitiz table), land-use, and all manner of\\n  other information (I observe that a remote-sen image tape often\\n  contain all manner of information about the spectral band  latitude,\\n  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pa  all of thi   can go into the PCI \"database\").\\n\\n  I _believe_ that on workstation the built-in display i us   On VAX\\n  system OTHER than workstation PCI support on a couple of specific\\n  third-party display system (the name Gould/Deanza seem to come to\\n  mind).  One of MY personal workaround wa a display program which would\\n  display direct from a PCI \"database\" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bu   24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be \"overkill\"\\n  in your case; it seem design for the very \"high end\"\\n  application user  i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC large doesn\\'t suffice\\n  (although a you know the gap i gett smaller all the time).  It\\'   probab no coincidence that PCI i locat in Canada, a country which\\n  doe a LOT of it land/resource management via remote sen  I believe\\n  the Canadian government use PCI software for some of it work in these\\n  area \\n\\nSPAM (Spectral Analysi Manager)\\n--------------------------------\\n  Back in 1985 JPL develop someth call SPAM (Spectral Analysi   Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.

To summarize:\\n  \\nSPACE ADVERTI     First, adverti on space vehicle i not new -- it i very\\ncommon practice to put the cooperat organization\\' logo on the\\nspace launch vehicle.  For example, the latest GP launcher had the\\n(very prominent) logo on it side of\\n   - McDonnell Dougla (the Delta launcher)\\n   - Rockwell International (who built the GP satellite)\\n   - USAF (who paid for the satellite and launch), and\\n   - the GP Navstar program office\\n   Thi ha not been consider \"paid adverti  but rather\\n\"public relation , since the restriction have been such that on organization involv in the launch could put their logo on the\\nside, and there wa no money exchang for thi   [However, putt a 10\\' high logo on the side of the launch vehicle fac the camera i \"adverti  a much a it i \"public relation , in my\\nopinion.]  [And by the way, I note that the DC-X test vehicle ha rather prominent McDonnell-Dougla and SDIO logo on the side...]\\n   There have been several studie look at the revenue potential for use of space vehicle for adverti  or plac large\\nadverti sign in orbit.  On the shuttle, for example, I know of\\nseveral seriou studie in the ear and mid 1980\\' which look at\\nputt logo on the external tank, or on the side of the payload\\nbay.  These venture would be different than \"public relation , in\\nthat the logo or display would not be restrict to the firm participat on that flight, and would involve payment of sum for\\nthe right to f the logo in a prominent organization.  (For\\nexample, paint the ET to look like a Pepsi can, or putt a\\nDisneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the camera would scan past it.)\\n  \\nADVERT ON LAUNCH VEHICLE    The first paid adverti wa done on a Soviet launcher in about\\n1990, when several non-involv foreign organization were allow to pay to put their logo on a Proton launch.  (An Italian shoe\\ncompany wa one of the first advertiser  I remember.)  Similar \\nSoviet cosmonaut on Mir made a paid advertisement for the last\\nOlympic game  and have gleeful shown banner and other item from\\nparticipat firm and organization   Mar candy bar  for\\nexample, got a plug from orbit a a sponsor of the launch of the\\nBritish visit cosmonaut to Mir.\\n   Now U firm are start to put paid advertisement on launch\\nvehicle   The upcom Conestoga launch (in June) putt the COMET\\nrecoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisement on the side, for Arnold Schwarzenegger\\' upcom movie \"The Last\\nAction Hero\".  Beside the usual logo of the participat organization  Columbia picture ha paid $500,000 to put ad on the\\nmain fuselage of the mission\\' Conestoga rocket, it booster\\nrocket  and on the COMET payload, which will orbit the Earth for\\none month.  A concept for thi adverti display wa publish in\\nSpace New magazine a couple of month ago.\\n   (A a side note: Robert Lorsch, an adverti executive, i talk about su NASA.  He charge NASA with appropriat an idea he\\ncreat with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate adverti sponsorship on NASA spacecraft a a way to get fund for the\\nspace program.  Lorsch contend that in sell adverti space on\\nthe upcom COMET, NASA violat an agreement that it \"would not use\\nhi idea without him be the exclusive representative for NASA and\\nreceiv compensation.\"   Thi i be disput  since the launch\\ni a \"commercial launch\" and NASA i receiv none of the\\nadverti revenue  but the fund for the COMET program i com from NASA.)\\n  \\nORBITAL \"BILLBOARD \\n   Orbital \"billboard  have been the staple of science fiction for\\nsome time.  Arthur C. Clarke wrote about one example, and Robert\\nHeinlein describ another in \"The Man Who Sold the Moon\".

Have unlimit supp of food provid  but no cloth  job  or knowledge.  God say not to eat fruit of tree of knowledge.  They do anyway, then try to hide \\nin bushe   God find them and force them out of Garden.\\n(There are several different storie on what they were do while nak in\\nthe bushe that might have anger God.)\\n\\nTraditional Philosophy:\\n1. The on reason you ne knowledge or a job i to eat.  If someone else will\\nprovide you with food, then you can be stupid and unemploy and it\\' OK. Thi i why marri women usual didn\\'t work until recent decade \\n2. Authority figure  such a God, whoever wa behind the Vietnam War, Hitler \\nand slaveowner  are alway right and should be blind follow without \\nquestion by ordinary people, who can\\'t make decision for themselve \\n\\nInterpretation of event bas on Traditional Philosophy:\\nThey were not suppos to eat the fruit.  They should have done whatever God\\ntold them to.  Like small children, they had their ne provid for and were\\nobligat to do whatever their \"Father\" said to.  Be forc to leave the \\nGarden and work in order to obtain food wa a punishment.\\n\\nLesson from Traditional Interpretation:\\n1.  Ignorance i good.  Knowledge i bad, but tempt \\n2.  Hav food provid for you for noth (read \"welfare\") i ideal.  Get-\\nt a job and fe yourself with what you earn i punishment.\\n3.  Public nudity i good.  Cover up i bad.\\n4.  Authority figure are intrinsical right.  Normal people are dumb and \\nshould do whatever they are told without question.  They should not think for \\nthemselve \\n5.  People in subordinate position are especial obligat to refrain from\\nlearn   For example, it should be illegal for slave to learn to read.\\n\\n1990\\' philosophy:\\n1.  People should seek education and employment outside the home, unle nam \"Hillary Clinton\" or \"Murphy Brown\".\\n2.  People should use common sense.

JPEG i design for compre either\\nfull-color or gray-scale digital image of \"natural\", real-world scene \\nIt doe not work so well on non-realistic image  such a cartoon or line\\ndrawing \\n\\nJPEG doe not handle black-and-white (1-bit-per-pixel) image  nor doe it\\nhandle motion picture compression.  Standard for compre those type of image are be work on by other committee  nam JBIG and MPEG\\nrespective \\n\\nJPEG i \"lossy\", mean that the image you get out of decompression isn\\'t\\nquite identical to what you original put in.  The algorithm achieve much\\nof it compression by exploit known limitation of the human eye, notab the fact that small color detail aren\\'t perceiv a well a small detail of light-and-dark.  Thu  JPEG i intend for compre image that will\\nbe look at by human   If you plan to machine-analyze your image  the\\nsmall error introduc by JPEG may be a problem for you, even if they are\\ninvisible to the eye.\\n\\nA useful property of JPEG i that the degree of lossine can be vari by\\nadjust compression parameter   Thi mean that the image maker can trade\\noff file size against output image quality.  You can make *extreme  small\\nfile if you don\\'t mind poor quality; thi i useful for index image\\narchive  mak thumbnail view or icon  etc. etc.  Converse  if you\\naren\\'t happy with the output quality at the default compression sett  you\\ncan jack up the quality until you are satisfi  and accept lesser compression.\\n\\n\\n[2]  Why use JPEG?\\n\\nThere are two good reason  to make your image file smaller, and to store\\n24-bit-per-pixel color data instead of 8-bit-per-pixel data.\\n\\nMak image file smaller i a big win for transmitt file acro network and for archiv librarie of image   Be able to compre a\\n2 Mbyte full-color file down to 100 Kbyte or so make a big difference in\\ndisk space and transmission time!  (If you are compar GIF and JPEG, the\\nsize ratio i more like four to one.  More detail below.)\\n\\nIf your view software doesn\\'t support JPEG direct  you\\'ll have to\\nconvert JPEG to some other format for view or manipulat image   Even\\nwith a JPEG-capable viewer, it take longer to decode and view a JPEG image\\nthan to view an image of a simpler format (GIF, for instance).  Thu  u JPEG i essential a time/space tradeoff: you give up some time in order to\\nstore or transmit an image more cheap \\n\\nIt\\' worth not that when network or phone transmission i involv  the\\ntime saving from transferr a shorter file can be much greater than the\\nextra time to decompre the file.  I\\'ll let you do the arithmetic yourself.\\n\\nThe other reason why JPEG will gradual replace GIF a a standard Usenet\\npost format i that JPEG can store full color information: 24 bit pixel\\n(16 million color  instead of 8 or le (256 or fewer color .  If you have\\non 8-bit display hardware then thi may not seem like much of an advantage\\nto you.  Within a couple of year  though, 8-bit GIF will look a obsolete a black-and-white MacPaint format doe today.  Furthermore, for reason detail in section 7, JPEG i far more useful than GIF for exchang image among\\npeople with wide vary color display hardware.  Hence JPEG i considerab more appropriate than GIF for use a a Usenet post standard.\\n\\n\\n[3]  When should I use JPEG, and when should I stick with GIF?\\n\\nJPEG i *not* go to displace GIF entire  for some type of image \\nGIF i superior in image quality, file size, or both.  One of the first\\nthing to learn about JPEG i which kind of image to app it to.\\n\\nA a rule of thumb, JPEG i superior to GIF for stor full-color or\\ngray-scale image of \"realistic\" scene  that mean scann photograph and\\nsimilar material.  JPEG i superior even if you don\\'t have 24-bit display\\nhardware, and it i a LOT superior if you do.  (See section 7 for detail )\\n\\nGIF doe significant better on image with on a few distinct color \\nsuch a cartoon and line drawing   In particular, large area of pixel that are all *exact  the same color are compress very efficient inde by GIF.  JPEG can\\'t squeeze these file a much a GIF doe without\\nintroduc visible defect   Thi sort of image i best kept in GIF form.\\n(In particular, single-color border are quite cheap in GIF file  but they\\nshould be avoid in JPEG file )\\n\\nJPEG also ha a hard time with very sharp edge  a row of pure-black pixel adjacent to a row of pure-white pixel  for example.  Sharp edge tend to\\ncome out blurr unle you use a very high quality sett   Again, thi sort of th i not found in scann photograph  but it show up fair often in GIF file  border  overlaid text, etc.  The blurrine i particular objectionable with text that\\' on a few pixel high.\\nIf you have a GIF with a lot of small-size overlaid text, don\\'t JPEG it.\\n\\nComputer-drawn image (ray-trac scene  for instance) usual fall between\\nscann image and cartoon in term of complexity.  The more complex and\\nsubt render the image, the more like that JPEG will do well on it.\\nThe same goe for semi-realistic artwork (fantasy drawing and such).\\n\\nPlain black-and-white (two level) image should never be convert to JPEG.\\nYou ne at least about 16 gray level before JPEG i useful for gray-scale\\nimage   It should also be not that GIF i lossle for gray-scale image of up to 256 level  while JPEG i not.\\n\\nIf you have an exist library of GIF image  you may wonder whether you\\nshould convert them to JPEG.  You will lose a little image quality if you do.\\n(Section 7, which argue that JPEG image quality i superior to GIF, on applie if both format start from a full-color original.  If you start from\\na GIF, you\\'ve already irretrievab lost a great deal of information; JPEG\\ncan on make thing worse.)  However, the disk space saving may justify\\nconvert anyway.  Thi i a decision you\\'ll have to make for yourself.\\nIf you do convert a GIF library to JPEG, see section 14 for hint   Be\\nprepar to leave some image in GIF format, since some GIF will not\\nconvert well.\\n\\n\\n[4]  How well doe JPEG compre image \\n\\nPretty darn well.  Here are some sample file size for an image I have\\nhandy, a 727x525 full-color image of a ship in a harbor.  The first three\\nfile are for comparison purpose  the rest were creat with the free JPEG\\nsoftware describ in section 6B.\\n\\nFile\\t   Size in byte \\tComment \\nship.ppm\\t1145040  Original file in PPM format (no compression; 24 bit \\t\\t\\t or 3 byte per pixel, plu a few byte overhead)\\nship.ppm.Z\\t 963829  PPM file pass through Unix compre \\t\\t\\t compre doesn\\'t accomplish a lot, you\\'ll note.\\n\\t\\t\\t Other text-orient compressor give similar result \\nship.gif\\t 240438  Convert to GIF with ppmquant -f 256 | ppmtogif\\n\\t\\t\\t Most of the saving i the result of lo color\\n\\t\\t\\t info: GIF save 8 bit pixel, not 24.  (See sec. 7.)\\n\\nship.jpg95\\t 155622  cjpeg -Q 95    (highest useful quality sett \\n\\t\\t\\t Thi i indistinguishable from the 24-bit original,\\n\\t\\t\\t at least to my nonprofessional eyeball \\nship.jpg75\\t  58009  cjpeg -Q 75    (default sett \\n\\t\\t\\t You have to look mighty darn close to distinguish thi \\t\\t\\t from the original, even with both on-screen at once.\\nship.jpg50\\t  38406  cjpeg -Q 50\\n\\t\\t\\t Thi ha slight defect  if you know what to look\\n\\t\\t\\t for, you could tell it\\' been JPEG without see \\t\\t\\t the original.  Still a good image quality a many\\n\\t\\t\\t recent posting in Usenet picture group \\nship.jpg25\\t  25192  cjpeg -Q 25\\n\\t\\t\\t JPEG\\' characteristic \"blockine  become apparent\\n\\t\\t\\t at thi sett (djpeg -blocksmooth help some).\\n\\t\\t\\t Still, I\\'ve seen plenty of Usenet posting that were\\n\\t\\t\\t of poorer image quality than thi \\nship.jpg5o\\t   6587  cjpeg -Q 5 -optimize  (-optimize cut table overhead)\\n\\t\\t\\t Blocky, but perfect satisfactory for preview or\\n\\t\\t\\t index purpose   Note that thi file i TINY:\\n\\t\\t\\t the compression ratio from the original i 173:1 !\\n\\nIn thi case JPEG can make a file that\\' a factor of four or five smaller\\nthan a GIF of comparable quality (the -Q 75 file i every bit a good a the\\nGIF, better if you have a full-color display).  Thi seem to be a typical\\nratio for real-world scene \\n\\n\\n[5]  What are good \"quality\" setting for JPEG?\\n\\nMost JPEG compressor let you pick a file size v  image quality tradeoff by\\nselect a quality sett   There seem to be widespread confusion about\\nthe mean of these setting   \"Quality 95\" doe NOT mean \"keep 95% of the\\ninformation\", a some have claim   The quality scale i pure arbitrary;\\nit\\' not a percentage of anyth \\n\\nThe name of the game in u JPEG i to pick the lowest quality sett (smallest file size) that decompresse into an image indistinguishable from\\nthe original.  Thi sett will vary from one image to another and from one\\nobserver to another, but here are some rule of thumb.\\n\\nThe default quality sett (-Q 75) i very often the best choice.  Thi sett i about the lowest you can go without expect to see defect in a\\ntypical image.  Try -Q 75 first; if you see defect  then go up.  Except for\\nexperimental purpose  never go above -Q 95; say -Q 100 will produce a\\nfile two or three time a large a -Q 95, but of hard any better quality.\\n\\nIf the image wa le than perfect quality to begin with, you might be able to\\ngo down to -Q 50 without objectionable degradation.  On the other hand, you\\nmight ne to go to a HIGHER quality sett to avoid further degradation.\\nThe second case seem to app much of the time when convert GIF to JPEG.\\nThe default -Q 75 i about right for compre 24-bit image  but -Q 85 to\\n95 i usual better for convert GIF (see section 14 for more info).\\n\\nIf you want a very small file (say for preview or index purpose  and are\\nprepar to tolerate large defect  a -Q sett in the range of 5 to 10 i about right.  -Q 2 or so may be amu a \"op art\".\\n\\n(Note: the quality setting discuss in thi article app to the free JPEG\\nsoftware describ in section 6B, and to many program bas on it.  Other\\nJPEG implementation  such a Image Alchemy, may use a complete different\\nquality scale.  Some program don\\'t even provide a numeric scale, just\\n\"high\"/\"medium\"/\"low\"-style choice )\\n\\n\\n[6]  Where can I get JPEG software?\\n\\nMost of the program describ in thi section are available by FTP.\\nIf you don\\'t know how to use FTP, see the FAQ article \"How to find source .\\n(If you don\\'t have direct acce to FTP, read about ftpmail server in the\\nsame article.)

The file i call \\'xv-???.tar.Z\\' (where ??? i the\\nversion number, current 2.21); it i locat in the \\'contrib\\' directory on\\nexport or the \\'pub/xv\\' directory at upenn.  XV reduce all image to 8 bit internal  which mean it\\' not a real good choice if you have a 24-bit\\ndisplay (you\\'ll still get on 8-bit color).  Also, you shouldn\\'t use XV to\\nconvert full-color image to JPEG, because they\\'ll get color-quantiz first.\\nBut XV i a fine tool for convert GIF and other 8-bit image to JPEG.\\nCAUTION: there i a glitch in version 2.21 and earlier: be sure to check\\nthe \"save at normal size\" checkbox when sav a JPEG file, or the file will\\nbe blurry.\\n\\nAnother good choice for X Window i John Cristy\\' free ImageMagick package,\\nalso available from export.lc mit.edu, file contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z.\\nThi package handle many image proce and conversion task   The\\nImageMagick viewer handle 24-bit display correct  for colormapp display  it doe better (though slower) color quantization than XV or the\\nbasic free JPEG software.\\n\\nBoth of the above are large, complex package   If you just want a simple\\nimage viewer, try xloadimage or xli.  xloadimage support JPEG in it latest\\nrelease, 3.03.  xloadimage i free and available from export.lc mit.edu,\\nfile contrib/xloadimage.3.03.tar.Z.  xli i a variant version of xloadimage,\\nsaid by it fan to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original.\\n(The current xli i inde faster and more robust than the current\\nxloadimage, at least with respect to JPEG file  because it ha the IJG v4\\ndecoder while xloadimage 3.03 i u a hack over v1.  The next\\nxloadimage release will fix thi )  xli i also free and available from\\nexport.lc mit.edu, file contrib/xli.1.14.tar.Z.  Both program are said\\nto do the right th with 24-bit display \\n\\n\\nM DO \\n\\nThi cover plain DO  for Window or O 2 program  see the next heading \\n\\nOne good choice i Eric Praetzel\\' free DVPEG, which view JPEG and GIF file \\nThe current version, 2.4a, i available by FTP from sunee.uwaterloo.ca\\n(129.97.50.50), file pub/jpeg/viewer dvpeg24a.zip.  Thi i a good basic\\nviewer that work on either 286 or 386/486 machine   The user interface i not flashy, but it\\' functional.\\n\\nAnother freeware JPEG/GIF/TGA viewer i Mohammad Rezaei\\' Hiview.  The\\ncurrent version, 1.2, i available from Simtel20 and mirror site (see NOTE\\nbelow), file msdo graphic hv12.zip.  Hiview require a 386 or better CPU\\nand a VCPI-compatible memory manager (QEMM386 and 386MAX work; Window and\\nO 2 do not).  Hiview i current the fastest viewer for image that are no\\nbigger than your screen.  For larger image  it scale the image down to fit\\non the screen (rather than u pann scroll a most viewer do).\\nYou may or may not prefer thi approach, but there\\' no deny that it\\nslow down load of large image considerab   Note: installation i a\\nbit tricky; read the direction careful \\n\\nA shareware alternative i ColorView for DO ($30).  Thi i easier to\\ninstall than either of the two freeware alternative   It user interface i also much spiffier-look  although personal I find it harder to use ---\\nmore keystroke  inconsistent behavior.  It i faster than DVPEG but a\\nlittle slower than Hiview, at least on my hardware.  (For image larger than\\nscreen size, DVPEG and ColorView seem to be about the same spe  and both\\nare faster than Hiview.)  The current version i 2.1, available from\\nSimtel20 and mirror site (see NOTE below), file msdo graphic dcview21.zip.\\nRequire a VESA graphic driver; if you don\\'t have one, look in vesadrv2.zip\\nor vesa-tsr.zip from the same directory.  (Many recent PC have a built-in\\nVESA driver, so don\\'t try to load a VESA driver unle ColorView complain that the driver i mi )\\n\\nA second shareware alternative i Fullview, which ha been kick around\\nthe net for a while, but I don\\'t know any stable archive location for it.\\nThe current (rather old) version i inferior to the above viewer anyway.\\nThe author tell me that a new version of Fullview will be out short and it will be submitt to the Simtel20 archive at that time.\\n\\nThe well-known GIF viewer CompuShow (CSHOW) support JPEG in it latest\\nrevision, 8.60a.  However, CSHOW\\' JPEG implementation isn\\'t very good:\\nit\\' slow (about half the spe of the above viewer  and image quality i poor except on hi-color display   Too bad ... it\\'d have been nice to see a\\ngood JPEG capability in CSHOW.  Shareware, $25.  Available from Simtel20 and\\nmirror site (see NOTE below), file msdo gif/cshw860a.zip.\\n\\nDue to the remarkable variety of PC graphic hardware, any one of these\\nviewer might not work on your particular machine.  If you can\\'t get *any*\\nof them to work, you\\'ll ne to use one of the follow conversion program to convert JPEG to GIF, then view with your favorite GIF viewer.  (If you\\nhave hi-color hardware, don\\'t use GIF a the intermediate format; try to\\nfind a TARGA-capable viewer instead.  VPIC5.0 i reput to do the right\\nth with hi-color display )\\n\\nThe Independent JPEG Group\\' free JPEG converter are FTPable from Simtel20\\nand mirror site (see NOTE below), file msdo graphic jpeg4.zip (or\\njpeg4386.zip if you have a 386 and extend memory).  These file are DO compilation of the free source code describ in section 6B; they will\\nconvert JPEG to and from GIF, Targa, and PPM format \\n\\nHandmade Software offer free JPEG<=>GIF conversion tool  GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF.\\nThese are slow and are limit to conversion to and from GIF format; in\\nparticular, you can\\'t get 24-bit color output from a JPEG.  The major\\nadvantage of these tool i that they will read and write HSI\\' proprietary\\nJPEG format a well a the Usenet-standard JFIF format.

To display a full-color image, the\\ncomputer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative\\ncolor   Thi proce i call \"color quantization\".  (Thi i someth of a misnomer, \"color selection\" would be a better term.  We\\'re stuck with\\nthe standard usage though.)\\n\\nClear  color quantization i a lossy proce   It turn out that for most\\nimage  the detail of the color quantization algorithm have MUCH more impact\\non the final image quality than do any error introduc by JPEG (except at\\nthe very lowest JPEG quality setting .\\n\\nSince JPEG i a full-color format, convert a color JPEG image for display\\non 8-bit-or-le hardware require color quantization.  Thi i true for\\n*all* color JPEG  even if you fe a 256-or-le color GIF into JPEG, what\\ncome out of the decompressor i *not* 256 color  but thousand of color \\nThi happen because JPEG\\' lossine affect each pixel a little\\ndifferent  so two pixel that start with identical color will probab come out with slight different color   Each original color get \"smear \\ninto a group of nearby color   Therefore quantization i alway requir to\\ndisplay a color JPEG on a colormapp display, regardle of the image\\nsource.  The on way to avoid quantization i to ask for gray-scale output.\\n\\n(Incidental  because of thi effect it\\' near meaningle to talk about\\nthe number of color us by a JPEG image.  Even if you attempt to count\\nthe number of distinct pixel value  different JPEG decoder would give you\\ndifferent result because of roundoff error difference   I occasional see\\npost image describ a \"256-color JPEG\".  Thi tell me that the poster\\n(a) hasn\\'t read thi FAQ and (b) probab convert the JPEG from a GIF.\\nJPEG can be classifi a color or gray-scale (just like photograph , but\\nnumber of color just isn\\'t a useful concept for JPEG.)\\n\\nOn the other hand, a GIF image by definition ha already been quantiz to\\n256 or fewer color   (A GIF *doe  have a definite number of color in it palette, and the format doesn\\'t allow more than 256 palette entrie )\\nFor purpose of Usenet picture distribution, GIF ha the advantage that the\\nsender precompute the color quantization, so recipient don\\'t have to.\\nThi i also the *disadvantage* of GIF: you\\'re stuck with the sender\\' quantization.  If the sender quantiz to a different number of color than\\nwhat you can display, you have to re-quantize, result in much poorer\\nimage quality than if you had quantiz once from a full-color image.\\nFurthermore, if the sender didn\\'t use a high-quality color quantization\\nalgorithm, you\\'re out of luck.\\n\\nFor thi reason, JPEG offer the promise of significant better image quality\\nfor all user whose machine don\\'t match the sender\\' display hardware.\\nJPEG\\' full color image can be quantiz to precise match the user\\' display\\nhardware.  Furthermore, you will be able to take advantage of future\\nimprovement in quantization algorithm (there i a lot of active research in\\nthi area), or purchase better display hardware, to get a better view of JPEG\\nimage you already have.  With a GIF, you\\'re stuck forevermore with what wa sent.\\n\\nIt\\' also worth mention that many GIF-view program include rather\\nshoddy quantization routine   If you view a 256-color GIF on a 16-color EGA\\ndisplay, for example, you are probab gett a much worse image than you\\nne to.  Thi i part an inevitable consequence of do two color\\nquantization (one to create the GIF, one to display it), but often it\\' also due to sloppine   JPEG conversion program will be forc to use\\nhigh quality quantizer in order to get acceptable result at all, and in\\nnormal use they will quantize direct to the number of color to be\\ndisplay   Thu  JPEG i like to provide better result than the average\\nGIF program for low-color-resolution display a well a high-resolution one \\n\\nFinal  an ever-grow number of people have better-than-8-bit display\\nhardware already: 15-bit \"hi-color\" PC display  true 24-bit display on\\nworkstation and Macintoshe  etc.  For these people, GIF i already\\nobsolete, a it cannot represent an image to the full capabilitie of their\\ndisplay.  JPEG image can drive these display much more effective \\nThu  JPEG i an all-around better choice than GIF for represent image in a machine-independent fashion.\\n\\n\\n[8]  How doe JPEG work?\\n\\nThe buzz-word to know are chrominance subsampl  discrete cosine\\ntransform  coefficient quantization, and Huffman or arithmetic entropy\\ncod   Thi article\\' long enough already, so I\\'m not go to say more\\nthan that here.  For technical information, see the comp.compression FAQ.\\nThi i available from the new answer archive at rtfm.mit.edu, in file /pub/usenet/new answer compression-faq/part[1-3].  If you ne help in\\nu the new answer archive, see the top of thi article.\\n\\n\\n[9]  What about lossle JPEG?\\n\\nThere\\' a great deal of confusion on thi subject.  The JPEG committee did\\ndefine a tru lossle compression algorithm, i.e., one that guarantee the\\nfinal output i bit-for-bit identical to the original input.  However, thi lossle mode ha almost noth in common with the regular, lossy JPEG\\nalgorithm, and it offer much le compression.  At present, very few\\nimplementation of lossle JPEG exist, and all of them are commercial.\\n\\nSay \"-Q 100\" to the free JPEG software DOE NOT get you a lossle image.\\nWhat it doe get rid of i deliberate information lo in the coefficient\\nquantization step.  There i still a good deal of information lo in the\\ncolor subsampl step.  (With the V4 free JPEG code, you can also say\\n\"-sample 1x1\" to turn off subsampl   Keep in mind that many commercial\\nJPEG implementation cannot cope with the result file.)\\n\\nEven with both quantization and subsampl turn off, the regular JPEG\\nalgorithm i not lossle  because it i subject to roundoff error in\\nvariou calculation   The maximum error i a few count in any one pixel\\nvalue; it\\' high unlike that thi could be perceiv by the human eye,\\nbut it might be a concern if you are do machine proce of an image.\\n\\nAt thi minimum-lo sett  regular JPEG produce file that are perhap half the size of an uncompress 24-bit-per-pixel image.  True lossle JPEG\\nprovide rough the same amount of compression, but it guarantee bit-for-bit accuracy.\\n\\nIf you have an application requir lossle storage of image with le than 6 bit per pixel (per color component), you may want to look into the\\nJBIG bilevel image compression standard.  Thi perform better than JPEG\\nlossle on such image   JPEG lossle i superior to JBIG on image with\\n6 or more bit per pixel; furthermore, JPEG i public domain (at least with a\\nHuffman back end), while the JBIG technique are heavi cover by patent \\n\\n\\n[10]  Why all the argument about file format \\n\\nStrict speak  JPEG refer on to a fami of compression algorithm \\nit doe *not* refer to a specific image file format.  The JPEG committee wa prevent from defin a file format by turf war within the international\\nstandard organization \\n\\nSince we can\\'t actual exchange image with anyone else unle we agree on\\na common file format, thi leave u with a problem.  In the absence of\\nofficial standard  a number of JPEG program writer have just gone off to\\n\"do their own th , and a a result their program aren\\'t compatible with\\nanybody else\\' \\n\\nThe closest th we have to a de-facto standard JPEG format i some work\\nthat\\' been coordinat by people at C-Cube Microsystem   They have defin two JPEG-bas file format \\n  * JFIF (JPEG File Interchange Format), a \"low-end\" format that transport     pixel and not much else.\\n  * TIFF/JPEG, aka TIFF 6.0, an extension of the Aldu TIFF format.  TIFF i     a \"high-end\" format that will let you record just about everyth you\\n    ever want to know about an image, and a lot more beside :-).  TIFF i     a lot more complex than JFIF, and may well prove le transportable,\\n    because different vendor have historical implement slight different\\n    and incompatible subset of TIFF.  It\\' not like that add JPEG to the\\n    mix will do anyth to improve thi situation.\\nBoth of these format were develop with input from all the major vendor of JPEG-relat product  it\\' reasonab like that future commercial\\nproduct will adhere to one or both standard \\n\\nI believe that Usenet should adopt JFIF a the replacement for GIF in\\npicture posting   JFIF i simpler than TIFF and i available now; the\\nTIFF 6.0 spec ha on recent been official adopt  and it i still\\nunusab vague on some crucial detail   Even when TIFF/JPEG i well\\ndefin  the JFIF format i like to be a wide support \"lowest common\\ndenominator\"; TIFF/JPEG file may never be a transportable.\\n\\nA particular case that people may be interest in i Apple\\' QuickTime\\nsoftware for the Macintosh.  QuickTime use a JFIF-compatible format wrapp inside the Mac-specific PICT structure.  Conversion between JFIF and\\nQuickTime JPEG i pretty straightforward, and several Mac program are\\navailable to do it (see Mac portion of section 6A).  If you have an editor\\nthat handle binary file  you can strip a QuickTime JPEG PICT down to JFIF\\nby hand; see section 11 for detail \\n\\nAnother particular case i Handmade Software\\' program (GIF2JPG/JPG2GIF and\\nImage Alchemy).  These program are capable of read and writ JFIF\\nformat.  By default, though, they write a proprietary format develop by\\nHSI.  Thi format i NOT readable by any non-HSI program and should not be\\nus for Usenet posting   Use the -j switch to get JFIF output.  (Thi applie to old version of these program  the current release emit JFIF\\nformat by default.  You still should be careful not to post HSI-format\\nfile  unle you want to get flam by people on non-PC platform )\\n\\n\\n[11]  How do I recognize which file format I have, and what do I do about it?\\n\\nIf you have an alleg JPEG file that your software won\\'t read, it\\' like to be HSI format or some other proprietary JPEG-bas format.  You can tell\\nwhat you have by inspect the first few byte of the file:\\n\\n1.  A JFIF-standard file will start with the character (hex) FF D8 FF E0,\\n    follow by two variable byte (often hex 00 10), follow by \\'JFIF\\'.\\n\\n2.  If you see FF D8 at the start, but not the rest of it, you may have a\\n    \"raw JPEG\" file.  Thi i probab decodable a i by JFIF software ---\\n    it\\' worth a try, anyway.\\n\\n3.  HSI file start with \\'hsi1\\'.  You\\'re out of luck unle you have HSI\\n    software.  Portion of the file may look like plain JPEG data, but they\\n    won\\'t decompre proper with non-HSI program \\n\\n4.  A Macintosh PICT file, if JPEG-compress  will have a couple hundr     byte of header follow by a JFIF header (scan for \\'JFIF\\').  Strip off\\n    everyth before the FF D8 and you should be able to read it.\\n\\n5.  Anyth else: it\\' a proprietary format, or not JPEG at all.  If you are\\n    lucky, the file may consist of a header and a raw JPEG data stream.\\n    If you can identify the start of the JPEG data stream (look for FF D8),\\n    try stripp off everyth before that.\\n\\nIn uuencod Usenet posting  the characteristic JFIF pattern i \\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM_]C_X ...\\n\\nwherea uuencod HSI file will start with\\n\\n\\t\"begin\" line\\n\\tM:\\'-I ...\\n\\nIf you learn to check for the former, you can save yourself the trouble of\\ndownload non-JFIF file \\n\\n\\n[12]  What about arithmetic cod \\n\\nThe JPEG spec define two different \"back end\" module for the final output\\nof compress data: either Huffman cod or arithmetic cod i allow \\nThe choice ha no impact on image quality, but arithmetic cod usual produce a smaller compress file.  On typical image  arithmetic cod produce a file 5 or 10 percent smaller than Huffman cod   (All the\\nfile-size number previou cit are for Huffman cod )\\n\\nUnfortunate  the particular variant of arithmetic cod specifi by the\\nJPEG standard i subject to patent own by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.\\nThu *you cannot legal use arithmetic cod  unle you obtain license from these companie   (The \"fair use\" doctrine allow people to implement\\nand test the algorithm, but actual stor any image with it i dubiou at best.)\\n\\nAt least in the short run, I recommend that people not worry about\\narithmetic cod  the space saving isn\\'t great enough to justify the\\npotential legal hassle   In particular, arithmetic cod *should not*\\nbe us for any image to be exchang on Usenet.\\n\\nThere i some small chance that the legal situation may change in the\\nfuture.  Stay tun for further detail \\n\\n\\n[13]  Doe lo accumulate with repeat compression/decompression?\\n\\nIt would be nice if, hav compress an image with JPEG, you could\\ndecompre it, manipulate it (crop off a border, say), and recompre it\\nwithout any further image degradation beyond what you lost initial \\nUnfortunate THI I NOT THE CASE.  In general, recompre an alter image lose more information, though usual not a much a wa lost the\\nfirst time around.\\n\\nThe next best th would be that if you decompre an image and recompre it *without chang it* then there i no further lo  i.e., you get an\\nidentical JPEG file.  Even thi i not true; at least, not with the current\\nfree JPEG software.  It\\' essential a problem of accumulation of roundoff\\nerror.  If you repeat compre and decompre  the image will eventual degrade to where you can see visible change from the first-generation\\noutput.  (It usual take many such cycle to get visible change.)\\nOne of the thing on our to-do list i to see if accumulation of error can\\nbe avoid or limit  but I am not optimistic about it.\\n\\nIn any case, the most that could possib be guarante would be that\\ncompre the unmodifi full-color output of djpeg, at the original\\nquality sett  would introduce no further lo   Even such simple change a cropp off a border could cause further roundoff-error degradation.\\n(If you\\'re wonder why, it\\' because the pixel-block boundarie move.\\nIf you cropp off on multiple of 16 pixel  you might be safe, but\\nthat\\' a mighty limit capability!)\\n\\nThe bottom line i that JPEG i a useful format for archival storage and\\ntransmission of image  but you don\\'t want to use it a an intermediate\\nformat for sequence of image manipulation step   Use a lossle format\\n(PPM, RLE, TIFF, etc) while work on the image, then JPEG it when you are\\nready to file it away.  Aside from avoid degradation, you will save a lot\\nof compression/decompression time thi way :-).\\n\\n\\n[14]  What are some rule of thumb for convert GIF image to JPEG?\\n\\nA stat earlier, you *will* lose some amount of image information if you\\nconvert an exist GIF image to JPEG.  If you can obtain the original\\nfull-color data the GIF wa made from, it\\' far better to make a JPEG from\\nthat.  But if you ne to save space and have on the GIF to work from,\\nhere are some suggestion for gett maximum space saving with minimum\\nlo of quality.\\n\\nThe first rule when convert a GIF library i to look at each JPEG, to\\nmake sure you are happy with it, before throw away the correspond GIF;\\nthat will give you a chance to re-do the conversion with a higher quality\\nsett if necessary.  Some GIF may be better left a GIF  a explain in\\nsection 3; in particular, cartoon-type GIF with sixteen or fewer color don\\'t convert well.  You may find that a JPEG file of reasonable quality\\nwill be *larger* than the GIF.  (So check the size too.)\\n\\nExperience to date suggest that large, high-visual-quality GIF are the best\\ncandidate for conversion to JPEG.  They chew up the most storage so offer\\nthe most potential saving  and they convert to JPEG with least degradation.\\nDon\\'t waste your time convert any GIF much under 100 Kbyte   Also, don\\'t\\nexpect JPEG file convert from GIF to be a small a those creat direct from full-color original   To maintain image quality you may have\\nto let the convert file be a much a twice a big a straight-through\\nJPEG file would be (i.e., shoot for 1/2 or 1/3rd the size of the GIF file,\\nnot 1/4th a suggest in earlier comparison .\\n\\nMany people have develop an odd habit of putt a large constant-color\\nborder around a GIF image.  While usele  thi wa near free in term of\\nstorage cost in GIF file   It i NOT free in JPEG file  and the sharp\\nborder boundary can create visible artifact (\"ghost\" edge .  Do yourself\\na favor and crop off any border before JPEG   (If you are on an X Window system, XV\\' manual and automatic cropp function are a very painle way to do thi )\\n\\ncjpeg\\' default Q sett of 75 i appropriate for full-color input, but\\nfor GIF input  Q setting of 85 to 95 often seem to be necessary to avoid\\nimage degradation.  (If you app smooth a suggest below, the higher\\nQ sett may not be necessary.)\\n\\nColor GIF of photograph or complex artwork are usual \"dither  to fool\\nyour eye into see more than the 256 color that GIF can actual store.\\nIf you enlarge the image, you will see that adjacent pixel are often of\\nsignificant different color  at normal size the eye average these pixel together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value.  The\\ntrouble with dither i that, to JPEG, it look like high-spatial-frequency\\ncolor noise; and JPEG can\\'t compre noise very well.  The result JPEG\\nfile i both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have\\ngotten from JPEG the original full color image (if you had it).\\nTo get around thi  you want to \"smooth\" the GIF image before compression.\\nSmooth average together nearby pixel  thu approximat the color that\\nyou thought you saw anyway, and in the proce gett rid of the rapid\\ncolor change that give JPEG trouble.  Appropriate use of smooth will\\noften let you avoid u a high Q factor, thu further reduc the size of\\nthe compress file, while still obtain a better-look output image\\nthan you\\'d get without smooth \\n\\nWith the V4 free JPEG software (or product bas on it), a simple smooth capability i built in.  Try \"-smooth 10\" or so when convert GIF \\nValue of 10 to 25 seem to work well for high-quality GIF   Heavy-hand dither may require larger smooth factor   (If you can see regular\\nfine-scale pattern on the GIF image even without enlargement, then strong\\nsmooth i definite call for.)  Too large a smooth factor will blur\\nthe output image, which you don\\'t want.  If you are an image proce wizard, you can also do smooth with a separate filter program, such a pnmconvol from the PBMPLU package.  However, cjpeg\\' built-in smoother i a LOT faster than pnmconvol...\\n\\nThe upshot of all thi i that \"cjpeg -quality 85 -smooth 10\" i probab a\\ngood start point for convert GIF   But if you real care about the\\nimage, you\\'ll want to check the result and maybe try a few other setting \\n\\n\\n---------------------\\n\\nFor more information about JPEG in general or the free JPEG software in\\nparticular, contact the Independent JPEG Group at jpeg-info@uunet.uu.net.\\n', u'\\n   >\\tIf the  new  Kuiper belt object *i   call \\'Karla\\', the next\\n   >one  should be call \\'Smiley\\'.\\n\\n   Unle I\\'m imag thing  (alway a possibility =) 1992 QB1, the Kuiper Belt\\n   object discover last year, i known a Smiley.\\n\\nA it happen the _second_ one i Karla.

(It wa a few month before _The Abyss_ came out.)\\nA far a I can remember, they mention three thing that were difficult\\nto do at once with a substitute breath fluid:\\n  - low viscosity --- if it' too difficult to force the fluid in & out \\n    of the lung  you can't extract enough oxygen to power your own\\n    breath effort (let alone anyth else)\\n\\n  - diffusion rate --- obviou  not all the air in your lung i     expell when you breathe out; and the part that isn't expell     i the part that' nearest the wall of the alveoli. (alveolu )\\n    So the trip from the blood vessel to the new air ha to be done\\n    by diffusion of the ga through the fluid. Apparent oxygen\\n    tend to diffuse more readi than CO2, so even if you can get enough\\n    oxygen in, you might not be able to get enough CO2 out.\\n\\n  - oxygen/CO2 capacity --- you have to be able to dissolve enough\\n    ga per unit volume. \\n\\n  Oh, and of course, your new breath fluid must not irritate the lung or interfere with their heal or anyth like that... \\n\", u'I ne a complete list of all the polygon that there are, in order.\\n\\nI\\'ll summarize to the net.\\n\\n\\n--------------------------------------------------------\\n   \"If on I had been compil with the \\'-g\\' option.\"', u\"\\n\\nIt on fall apart if you attempt to app it.

Introduction\\nThe solar sail i a well-establish concept. Harne the pressure of\\nsunlight, a spacecraft would have unlimit range. In principle, such a\\nvehicle could explore the whole Solar System with zero fuel consumption.\\n\\nHowever it i more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most\\npeople realize. The pressure of sunlight i on about one kilogram per\\nsquare kilometer. Deploy and controll the large area of aluminiz fabric which would be necessary to transport a 'conventional' type\\nspacecraft i a daunt task. Thi i why, despite the potential of hte\\nidea, no such craft ha actual been launch to date.\\n\\n2.Design\\nRecent advance in microelectronic make possible a different concept: a\\ntiny sail just a few metre in diameter which could be controll pure be electronic  with no mechanical part  Several attitude control\\nmethod are feasible: for example the pressure sunlight exert on a\\npanel of solar cell varie accord to whether power i be drawn.\\n\\nThe key component of the craft will be a minute CCD camera develop at\\nEdinburgh University which can act a both attitude sensor and data\\ngather device; solar cell provid ~1 watt power for control and\\ncommunication; and a directional radio antenna etch onto the surface\\nof the sail itself. Launch a a piggyback payload, the total cost of\\nthe mission can be limit to a few ten of thousand of dollar \\n\\n3.Mission The craft would be capable of some ambitiou mission  For example:\\na) It could rendezvou with a nearby asteroid from the Apollo or Amor\\ngroup  Closeup picture could be transmitt back to Earth at a low bit\\nrate.\\nb) It could be steer into a lunar polar orbit. Previou unobserv area around the lunar pole could be view  By angl the sail to\\nreflect sunlight downward  polar crater whose base never receive\\nsunlight could be imag  Bright reflection would confirm that\\nvolatile such a water ice have become trapp in these\\nlocation [Immense valuable information for sett up a mann lunar\\nbase, BTW]\\nc) It could be sent to rendezvou with a small asteroid or comet\\nnucleu  Impact at low spe  a thin wire probe attach to the craft\\ncause it to rebound while captur a tiny sample i a sharp-edg tube, like perform a biopsy. Return to Earth, the sail act a an\\nideal re-entry parachute: load per unit area 20 gm/m2 ensure that heat\\ni reradiat so efective that the sail temperature cannot exce ~300\\ndeg C.

Whilst I\\nhave tri to be a neutral a possible regard contentiou issue  you\\nshould alway remember that thi document represent on one viewpoint.  I\\nwould encourage you to read wide and draw your own conclusion  some\\nrelevant book are list in a companion article.\\n\\nTo provide a sense of cohesion and progression, I have present thi article\\na an imaginary conversation between an atheist and a theist.  All the\\nquestion ask by the imaginary theist are question which have been cropp up repeat on alt.atheism since the newsgroup wa creat   Some other\\nfrequent ask question are answer in a companion article.\\n\\nPlease note that thi article i arguab slant toward answer question pos from a Christian viewpoint.  Thi i because the FAQ file reflect\\nquestion which have actual been ask  and it i predominant Christian who proselytize on alt.atheism.\\n\\nSo when I talk of religion, I am talk primari about religion such a Christianity, Judaism and Islam, which involve some sort of superhuman divine\\nbe   Much of the discussion will app to other religion  but some of it\\nmay not.\\n\\n\"What i atheism?\"\\n\\nAtheism i characteriz by an absence of belief in the existence of God.\\nSome atheist go further, and believe that God doe not exist.  The former i often referr to a the \"weak atheist\" position, and the latter a \"strong\\natheism\".\\n\\nIt i important to note the difference between these two position   \"Weak\\natheism\" i simple scepticism; disbelief in the existence of God.  \"Strong\\natheism\" i a positive belief that God doe not exist.  Please do not\\nfall into the trap of assum that all atheist are \"strong atheist .\\n\\nSome atheist believe in the non-existence of all God  other limit their\\natheism to specific God  such a the Christian God, rather than mak flat-out denial \\n\\n\"But isn\\'t disbeliev in God the same th a believ he doesn\\'t exist?\"\\n\\nDefinite not.  Disbelief in a proposition mean that one doe not believe\\nit to be true.  Not believ that someth i true i not equivalent to\\nbeliev that it i false; one may simp have no idea whether it i true or\\nnot.  Which bring u to agnosticism.\\n\\n\"What i agnosticism then?\"\\n\\nThe term \\'agnosticism\\' wa coin by Professor Huxley at a meet of the\\nMetaphysical Society in 1876.  He defin an agnostic a someone who\\ndisclaim (\"strong\") atheism and believ that the ultimate origin of thing must be some cause unknown and unknowable.\\n\\nThu an agnostic i someone who believe that we do not and cannot know for\\nsure whether God exist \\n\\nWord are slippery thing  and language i inexact.  Beware of assum that\\nyou can work out someone\\' philosophical point of view simp from the fact\\nthat she call herself an atheist or an agnostic.  For example, many people\\nuse agnosticism to mean \"weak atheism\", and use the word \"atheism\" on when\\nreferr to \"strong atheism\".\\n\\nBeware also that because the word \"atheist\" ha so many shade of mean  it\\ni very difficult to generalize about atheist   About all you can say for\\nsure i that atheist don\\'t believe in God.  For example, it certain isn\\'t\\nthe case that all atheist believe that science i the best way to find out\\nabout the universe.\\n\\n\"So what i the philosophical justification or basi for atheism?\"\\n\\nThere are many philosophical justification for atheism.  To find out why a\\nparticular person choose to be an atheist, it\\' best to ask her.\\n\\nMany atheist feel that the idea of God a present by the major religion i essential self-contradictory, and that it i logical impossible that\\nsuch a God could exist.  Other are atheist through scepticism, because they\\nsee no evidence that God exist \\n\\n\"But isn\\'t it impossible to prove the non-existence of someth \"\\n\\nThere are many counter-example to such a statement.  For example, it i quite simple to prove that there doe not exist a prime number larger than\\nall other prime number   Of course, thi deal with well-defin object obey well-defin rule   Whether God or universe are similar well-defin i a matter for debate.\\n\\nHowever, assum for the moment that the existence of a God i not provab impossible, there are still subtle reason for assum the non-existence of\\nGod.  If we assume that someth doe not exist, it i alway possible to\\nshow that thi assumption i invalid by find a single counter-example.\\n\\nIf on the other hand we assume that someth doe exist, and if the th in\\nquestion i not provab impossible, show that the assumption i invalid\\nmay require an exhaustive search of all possible place where such a th might be found, to show that it isn\\'t there.  Such an exhaustive search i often impractical or impossible.  There i no such problem with largest\\nprime  because we can prove that they don\\'t exist.\\n\\nTherefore it i general accept that we must assume thing do not exist\\nunle we have evidence that they do.  Even theist follow thi rule most of\\nthe time; they don\\'t believe in unicorn  even though they can\\'t conclusive prove that no unicorn exist anywhere.\\n\\nTo assume that God exist i to make an assumption which probab cannot be\\ntest   We cannot make an exhaustive search of everywhere God might be to\\nprove that he doesn\\'t exist anywhere.  So the sceptical atheist assume by\\ndefault that God doe not exist, since that i an assumption we can test.\\n\\nThose who profe strong atheism usual do not claim that no sort of God\\nexist  instead, they general restrict their claim so a to cover\\nvarietie of God describ by follower of variou religion   So whilst it\\nmay be impossible to prove conclusive that no God exist  it may be\\npossible to prove that (say) a God a describ by a particular religiou book doe not exist.  It may even be possible to prove that no God describ by any present-day religion exist \\n\\nIn practice, believ that no God describ by any religion exist i very\\nclose to believ that no God exist   However, it i sufficient different\\nthat counter-argument bas on the impossibility of disprov every kind of\\nGod are not real applicable.\\n\\n\"But what if God i essential non-detectable?\"\\n\\nIf God interact with our universe in any way, the effect of hi interaction\\nmust be measurable.  Hence hi interaction with our universe must be\\ndetectable.\\n\\nIf God i essential non-detectable, it must therefore be the case that he\\ndoe not interact with our universe in any way.  Many atheist would argue\\nthat if God doe not interact with our universe at all, it i of no\\nimportance whether he exist or not.\\n\\nIf the Bible i to be believ  God wa easi detectable by the Israelite \\nSure he should still be detectable today?\\n\\nNote that I am not demand that God interact in a scientifical verifiable, physical way.  It must sure be possible to perceive some\\neffect caus by hi presence, though; otherwise, how can I distinguish him\\nfrom all the other thing that don\\'t exist?\\n\\n\"OK, you may think there\\' a philosophical justification for atheism, but\\n isn\\'t it still a religiou belief?\"\\n\\nOne of the most common pastime in philosophical discussion i \"the\\nredefinition game\".  The cynical view of thi game i a follow \\n\\nPerson A begin by mak a contentiou statement.  When person B point out\\nthat it can\\'t be true, person A gradual re-define the word he us in the\\nstatement until he arrive at someth person B i prepar to accept.  He\\nthen record the statement, along with the fact that person B ha agre to\\nit, and continue   Eventual A use the statement a an \"agre fact\", but\\nuse hi original definition of all the word in it rather than the obscure\\nredefinition original need to get B to agree to it.  Rather than be seen\\nto be apparent inconsistent, B will tend to play along.\\n\\nThe point of thi digression i that the answer to the question \"Isn\\'t\\natheism a religiou belief?\" depend crucial upon what i meant by\\n\"religiou .  \"Religion\" i general characteriz by belief in a superhuman\\ncontroll power -- especial in some sort of God -- and by faith and\\nworship.\\n\\n[ It\\' worth point out in pa that some varietie of Buddhism are not\\n  \"religion\" accord to such a definition. ]\\n\\nAtheism i certain not a belief in any sort of superhuman power, nor i it\\ncategoriz by worship in any meaningful sense.  Widen the definition of\\n\"religiou  to encompa atheism tend to result in many other aspect of\\nhuman behaviour sudden becom class a \"religiou  a well -- such a science, politic  and watch TV.\\n\\n\"OK, so it\\' not a religion.  But sure belief in atheism (or science) i  still just an act of faith, like religion i \"\\n\\nFirst  it\\' not entire clear that sceptical atheism i someth one\\nactual believe in.\\n\\nSecond  it i necessary to adopt a number of core belief or assumption to\\nmake some sort of sense out of the sensory data we experience.  Most atheist try to adopt a few core belief a possible; and even those are subject to\\nquestion if experience throw them into doubt.\\n\\nScience ha a number of core assumption   For example, it i general assum that the law of physic are the same for all observer   These are\\nthe sort of core assumption atheist make.  If such basic idea are call \"act of faith\", then almost everyth we know must be said to be bas on\\nact of faith, and the term lose it mean \\n\\nFaith i more often us to refer to complete, certain belief in someth \\nAccord to such a definition, atheism and science are certain not act of\\nfaith.  Of course, individual atheist or scientist can be a dogmatic a religiou follower when claim that someth i \"certain\".  Thi i not a\\ngeneral tendency, however; there are many atheist who would be reluctant to\\nstate with certainty that the universe exist \\n\\nFaith i also us to refer to belief without support evidence or proof.\\nSceptical atheism certain doesn\\'t fit that definition, a sceptical atheism\\nha no belief   Strong atheism i closer, but still doesn\\'t real match, a even the most dogmatic atheist will tend to refer to experimental data (or\\nthe lack of it) when assert that God doe not exist.\\n\\n\"If atheism i not religiou  sure it\\' anti-religiou \"\\n\\nIt i an unfortunate human tendency to label everyone a either \"for\" or\\n\"against\", \"friend\" or \"enemy\".  The truth i not so clear-cut.\\n\\nAtheism i the position that run logical counter to theism; in that sense,\\nit can be said to be \"anti-religion\".  However, when religiou believer speak of atheist be \"anti-religiou  they usual mean that the atheist have some sort of antipathy or hatr toward theist \\n\\nThi categorization of atheist a hostile toward religion i quite unfair.\\nAtheist attitude toward theist in fact cover a broad spectrum.\\n\\nMost atheist take a \"live and let live\" attitude.  Unle question  they\\nwill not usual mention their atheism, except perhap to close friend   Of\\ncourse, thi may be in part because atheism i not \"social acceptable\" in\\nmany countrie \\n\\nA few atheist are quite anti-religiou  and may even try to \"convert\" other when possible.  Historical  such anti-religiou atheist have made little\\nimpact on society outside the Eastern Bloc countrie \\n\\n(To digre slight  the Soviet Union wa original dedicat to separation\\nof church and state, just like the USA.  Soviet citizen were legal free to\\nworship a they wish   The institution of \"state atheism\" came about when\\nStalin took control of the Soviet Union and tri to destroy the churche in\\norder to gain complete power over the population.)\\n\\nSome atheist are quite vocal about their belief  but on where they see\\nreligion encroach on matter which are not it busine -- for example,\\nthe government of the USA.  Such individual are usual concern that\\nchurch and state should remain separate.\\n\\n\"But if you don\\'t allow religion to have a say in the runn of the state,\\n sure that\\' the same a state atheism?\"\\n\\nThe principle of the separation of church and state i that the state shall\\nnot legislate concern matter of religiou belief.  In particular, it\\nmean not on that the state cannot promote one religion at the expense of\\nanother, but also that it cannot promote any belief which i religiou in\\nnature.\\n\\nReligion can still have a say in discussion of pure secular matter   For\\nexample, religiou believer have historical been responsible for\\nencourag many political reform   Even today, many organization campaign for an increase in spend on foreign aid are found a religiou campaign   So long a they campaign concern secular matter \\nand so long a they do not discriminate on religiou ground  most atheist are quite happy to see them have their say.\\n\\n\"What about prayer in school  If there\\' no God, why do you care if people\\n pray?\"\\n\\nBecause people who do pray are voter and lawmaker  and tend to do thing that those who don\\'t pray can\\'t just ignore.  Also, Christian prayer in\\nschool i intimidat to non-Christian  even if they are told that they\\nne not join in.  The diversity of religiou and non-religiou belief mean that it i impossible to formulate a meaningful prayer that will be\\nacceptable to all those present at any public event.\\n\\nAlso, non-prayer tend to have friend and fami who pray.  It i reasonable\\nto care about friend and fami wast their time, even without other\\nmotive \\n\\n\"You mention Christian who campaign for increas foreign aid.  What about\\n atheist   Why aren\\'t there any atheist charitie or hospital   Don\\'t\\n atheist object to the religiou charitie \"\\n\\nThere are many charitie without religiou purpose that atheist can\\ncontribute to.  Some atheist contribute to religiou charitie a well, for\\nthe sake of the practical good they do.  Some atheist even do voluntary work\\nfor charitie found on a theistic basi \\n\\nMost atheist seem to feel that atheism isn\\'t worth shout about in\\nconnection with charity.  To them, atheism i just a simple, obviou everyday\\nmatter, and so i charity.  Many feel that it\\' somewhat cheap, not to say\\nself-righteou  to use simple charity a an excuse to plug a particular set\\nof religiou belief \\n\\nTo \"weak\" atheist  build a hospital to say \"I do not believe in God\" i a\\nrather strange idea; it\\' rather like hold a party to say \"Today i not my\\nbirthday\".  Why the fu   Atheism i rare evangelical.\\n\\n\"You said atheism isn\\'t anti-religiou   But i it perhap a backlash against\\n one\\' upbring  a way of rebell \"\\n\\nPerhap it i  for some.  But many people have parent who do not attempt to\\nforce any religiou (or atheist) idea upon them, and many of those people\\nchoose to call themselve atheist \\n\\nIt\\' also doubtle the case that some religiou people chose religion a a\\nbacklash against an atheist upbring  a a way of be different.  On the\\nother hand, many people choose religion a a way of conform to the\\nexpectation of other \\n\\nOn the whole, we can\\'t conclude much about whether atheism or religion are\\nbacklash or conformism; although in general, people have a tendency to go\\nalong with a group rather than act or think independent \\n\\n\"How do atheist differ from religiou people?\"\\n\\nThey don\\'t believe in God.  That\\' all there i to it.\\n\\nAtheist may listen to heavy metal -- backward  even -- or they may prefer a\\nVerdi Requiem, even if they know the word   They may wear Hawaiian shirt \\nthey may dre all in black, they may even wear orange robe   (Many\\nBuddhist lack a belief in any sort of God.)  Some atheist even carry a copy\\nof the Bible around -- for argu against, of course!\\n\\nWhoever you are, the chance are you have met several atheist without\\nreali it.  Atheist are usual unexceptional in behaviour and\\nappearance.\\n\\n\"Unexceptional? But aren\\'t atheist le moral than religiou people?\"\\n\\nThat depend   If you define morality a obedience to God, then of course\\natheist are le moral a they don\\'t obey any God.  But usual when one\\ntalk of morality, one talk of what i acceptable (\"right\") and unacceptable\\n(\"wrong\") behaviour within society.\\n\\nHuman are social animal  and to be maximal successful they must\\nco-operate with each other.  Thi i a good enough reason to discourage most\\natheist from \"anti-social\" or \"immoral\" behaviour, pure for the purpose of self-preservation.\\n\\nMany atheist behave in a \"moral\" or \"compassionate\" way simp because they\\nfeel a natural tendency to empathize with other human   So why do they care\\nwhat happen to other   They don\\'t know, they simp are that way.\\n\\nNatural  there are some people who behave \"immoral  and try to use\\natheism to justify their action   However, there are equal many people who\\nbehave \"immoral  and then try to use religiou belief to justify their\\naction   For example:\\n\\n  \"Here i a trustworthy say that deserve full acceptance: Jesu Christ\\n   came into the world to save sinner ..  But for that very reason, I wa    shown mercy so that in me...  Jesu Christ might display Hi unlimit    patience a an example for those who would believe in him and receive\\n   eternal life.  Now to the k eternal, immortal, invisible, the on God,\\n   be honor and glory forever and ever.\"\\n\\nThe above quote i from a statement made to the court on February 17th 1992\\nby Jeffrey Dahmer, the notoriou cannibal serial killer of Milwaukee,\\nWisconsin.  It seem that for every atheist ma murderer, there i a\\nreligiou ma murderer.  But what of more trivial morality?\\n\\n   A survey conduct by the Roper Organization found that behavior\\n   deteriorat after \"born again\" experience   While on 4% of respondent    said they had driven intoxicat before be \"born again,\" 12% had done\\n   so after conversion.  Similar  5% had us illegal drug before\\n   conversion, 9% after.  Two percent admitt to engag in illicit sex\\n   before salvation; 5% after.\\n                                [\"Freethought Today\", September 1991, p. 12.]\\n\\nSo it seem that at best, religion doe not have a monopo on moral\\nbehaviour.\\n\\n\"I there such a th a atheist morality?\"\\n\\nIf you mean \"I there such a th a morality for atheist \", then the\\nanswer i ye  a explain above.  Many atheist have idea about morality\\nwhich are at least a strong a those held by religiou people.\\n\\nIf you mean \"Doe atheism have a characteristic moral code?\", then the answer\\ni no.  Atheism by itself doe not imp anyth much about how a person\\nwill behave.  Most atheist follow many of the same \"moral rule  a theist \\nbut for different reason   Atheist view morality a someth creat by\\nhuman  accord to the way human feel the world \\'ought\\' to work, rather\\nthan see it a a set of rule decre by a supernatural be \\n\\n\"Then aren\\'t atheist just theist who are deny God?\"\\n\\nA study by the Freedom From Religion Foundation found that over 90% of the\\natheist who respond became atheist because religion did not work for\\nthem.  They had found that religiou belief were fundamental incompatible\\nwith what they observ around them.\\n\\nAtheist are not unbeliever through ignorance or denial; they are\\nunbeliever through choice.  The vast majority of them have spent time\\nstudy one or more religion  sometime in very great depth.  They have\\nmade a careful and consider decision to reject religiou belief \\n\\nThi decision may, of course, be an inevitable consequence of that\\nindividual\\' personality.  For a natural sceptical person, the choice\\nof atheism i often the on one that make sense, and hence the on choice that person can honest make.\\n\\n\"But don\\'t atheist want to believe in God?\"\\n\\nAtheist live their live a though there i nobody watch over them.  Many\\nof them have no desire to be watch over, no matter how good-natur the\\n\"Big Brother\" figure might be.\\n\\nSome atheist would like to be able to believe in God -- but so what? Should\\none believe thing mere because one want them to be true?  The risk of\\nsuch an approach should be obviou   Atheist often decide that want to\\nbelieve someth i not enough; there must be evidence for the belief.\\n\\n\"But of course atheist see no evidence for the existence of God -- they are\\n unwill in their soul to see!\"\\n\\nMany, if not most atheist were previou religiou   A ha been explain above, the vast majority have seriou consider the possibility that God\\nexist   Many atheist have spent time in prayer try to reach God.\\n\\nOf course, it i true that some atheist lack an open mind; but assum that\\nall atheist are bias and insincere i offensive and clos mind \\nComment such a \"Of course God i there, you just aren\\'t look proper \\nare like to be view a patroniz \\n\\nCertain  if you wish to engage in philosophical debate with atheist it i vital that you give them the benefit of the doubt and assume that they are\\nbe sincere if they say that they have search for God.  If you are not\\nwill to believe that they are basical tell the truth, debate i futile.\\n\\n\"Isn\\'t the whole of life complete pointle to an atheist?\"\\n\\nMany atheist live a purposeful life.  They decide what they think give mean to life, and they pursue those goal   They try to make their live count, not by wish for eternal life, but by hav an influence on other\\npeople who will live on.  For example, an atheist may dedicate hi life to\\npolitical reform, in the hope of leav hi mark on history.\\n\\nIt i a natural human tendency to look for \"mean  or \"purpose\" in random\\nevent   However, it i by no mean obviou that \"life\" i the sort of th that ha a \"mean .\\n\\nTo put it another way, not everyth which look like a question i actual a sensible th to ask.  Some atheist believe that ask \"What i the\\nmean of life?\" i a sil a ask \"What i the mean of a cup of\\ncoffee?\".  They believe that life ha no purpose or mean  it just i \\n\\n\"So how do atheist find comfort in time of danger?\"\\n\\nThere are many way of obtain comfort; from fami  friend  or even pet \\nOr on a le spiritual level, from food or drink or TV.\\n\\nThat may sound rather an empty and vulnerable way to face danger, but so\\nwhat?  Should individual believe in thing because they are comfort  or\\nshould they face reality no matter how harsh it might be?\\n\\nIn the end, it\\' a decision for the individual concern   Most atheist are\\nunable to believe someth they would not otherwise believe mere because\\nit make them feel comfortable.  They put truth before comfort, and consider\\nthat if search for truth sometime make them feel unhappy, that\\' just\\nhard luck.\\n\\n\"Don\\'t atheist worry that they might sudden be shown to be wrong?\"\\n\\nThe short answer i \"No, do you?\"\\n\\nMany atheist have been atheist for year   They have encounter many\\nargument and much suppos evidence for the existence of God, but they have\\nfound all of it to be invalid or inconclusive.\\n\\nThousand of year of religiou belief haven\\'t result in any good proof of\\nthe existence of God.  Atheist therefore tend to feel that they are unlike to be prov wrong in the immediate future, and they stop worry about it.\\n\\n\"So why should theist question their belief  Don\\'t the same argument  app \"\\n\\nNo, because the belief be question are not similar.  Weak atheism i the sceptical \"default position\" to take; it assert noth   Strong atheism\\ni a negative belief.  Theism i a very strong positive belief.\\n\\nAtheist sometime also argue that theist should question their belief because of the very real harm they can cause -- not just to the believer \\nbut to everyone else.\\n\\n\"What sort of harm?\"\\n\\nReligion represent a huge financial and work burden on mankind.  It\\' not\\njust a matter of religiou believer wast their money on church building \\nthink of all the time and effort spent build churche  pray  and so on.\\nImagine how that effort could be better spent.\\n\\nMany theist believe in miracle heal   There have been plenty of instance of ill people be \"heal  by a priest, cea to take the medicine prescrib to them by doctor  and dy a a result.  Some theist have di because they have refus blood transfusion on religiou ground \\n\\nIt i arguable that the Catholic Church\\' opposition to birth control -- and\\ncondom in particular -- i increa the problem of overpopulation in many\\nthird-world countrie and contribut to the spread of AID world-wide.\\n\\nReligiou believer have been known to murder their children rather than\\nallow their children to become atheist or marry someone of a different\\nreligion.\\n\\n\"Those weren\\'t REAL believer   They just claim to be believer a some\\n sort of excuse.\"\\n\\nWhat make a real believer?  There are so many One True Religion it\\' hard\\nto tell.  Look at Christianity: there are many compet group  all\\nconvinc that they are the on true Christian   Sometime they even fight\\nand kill each other.  How i an atheist suppos to decide who\\' a REAL\\nChristian and who isn\\'t, when even the major Christian churche like the\\nCatholic Church and the Church of England can\\'t decide amongst themselve \\n\\nIn the end, most atheist take a pragmatic view, and decide that anyone who\\ncall himself a Christian, and use Christian belief or dogma to justify hi action  should be consider a Christian.  Maybe some of those Christian are just pervert Christian teach for their own end -- but sure if\\nthe Bible can be so readi us to support un-Christian act it can\\'t be\\nmuch of a moral code? If the Bible i the word of God, why couldn\\'t he have\\nmade it le easy to misinterpret? And how do you know that your belief aren\\'t a perversion of what your God intend \\n\\nIf there i no single unambiguou interpretation of the Bible, then why\\nshould an atheist take one interpretation over another just on your say-so?\\nSorry, but if someone claim that he believe in Jesu and that he murder other because Jesu and the Bible told him to do so, we must call him a\\nChristian.\\n\\n\"Obviou those extreme sort of belief should be question   But since\\n nobody ha ever prov that God doe not exist, it must be very unlike  that more basic religiou belief  shar by all faith  are nonsense.\"\\n\\nThat doe not hold, because a wa point out at the start of thi dialogue,\\npositive assertion concern the existence of entitie are inherent much\\nharder to disprove than negative one   Nobody ha ever prov that unicorn don\\'t exist, but that doesn\\'t make it unlike that they are myth \\n\\nIt i therefore much more valid to hold a negative assertion by default than\\nit i to hold a positive assertion by default.  Of course, \"weak\" atheist would argue that assert noth i better still.\\n\\n\"Well, if atheism\\' so great, why are there so many theist \"\\n\\nUnfortunate  the popularity of a belief ha little to do with how \"correct\"\\nit i  or whether it \"work ; consider how many people believe in astrology,\\ngraphology, and other pseudo-science \\n\\nMany atheist feel that it i simp a human weakne to want to believe in\\ngod   Certain in many primitive human societie  religion allow the\\npeople to deal with phenomena that they do not adequate understand.\\n\\nOf course, there\\' more to religion than that.  In the industrializ world,\\nwe find people believ in religiou explanation of phenomena even when\\nthere are perfect adequate natural explanation   Religion may have start a a mean of attempt to explain the world, but nowaday it serve other\\npurpose a well.\\n\\n\"But so many culture have develop religion   Sure that must say\\n someth \"\\n\\nNot real   Most religion are on superficial similar; for example, it\\' worth remember that religion such a Buddhism and Taoism lack any sort of\\nconcept of God in the Christian sense.\\n\\nOf course, most religion are quick to denounce compet religion  so it\\' rather odd to use one religion to try and justify another.\\n\\n\"What about all the famou scientist and philosopher who have conclud  that God exist \"\\n\\nFor every scientist or philosopher who believe in a god, there i one who\\ndoe not.  Beside  a ha already been point out, the truth of a belief i not determin by how many people believe it.  Also, it i important to\\nrealize that atheist do not view famou scientist or philosopher in the\\nsame way that theist view their religiou leader \\n\\nA famou scientist i on human; she may be an expert in some field  but\\nwhen she talk about other matter her word carry no special weight.  Many\\nrespect scientist have made themselve look foolish by speak on\\nsubject which lie outside their field of expertise.\\n\\n\"So are you real say that widespread belief in religion indicate  noth \"\\n\\nNot entire   It certain indicate that the religion in question ha propertie which have help it so spread so far.\\n\\nThe theory of memetic talk of \"meme  -- set of idea which can propagate\\nthemselve between human mind  by analogy with gene   Some atheist view\\nreligion a set of particular successful parasitic meme  which spread by\\nencourag their host to convert other   Some meme avoid destruction by\\ndiscourag believer from question doctrine, or by u peer pressure\\nto keep one-time believer from admitt that they were mistaken.

It ha a density of 0.058 lb/cu in,\\ntherefore the theoretical height for a constant section column\\nthat can just support itself i 4.8 million inche  or 400,000 ft,\\nor 75 Statute mile \\n\\nNow, a real structure will have horizontal brac (either a tru type, or guy wire  or both) and will be us below the crush strength.\\nLet u assume that we will operate at 40% of the theoretical \\nstrength.  Thi give a work height of 30 mile for a constant\\nsection column.  \\n\\nA constant section column i not the limit on how high you can\\nbuild someth if you allow a taper of the cro section\\na you go up.  For example, let u say you have a 280,000 pound\\nload to support at the top of the tower (for simplicity in\\ncalculation).  Thi require 2.5 square inche of column cro sectional area to support the weight.  The mile of structure\\nbelow the payload will itself weigh 9,200 lb, so at 1 mile \\nbelow the payload, the total load i now 289,200 lb, a 3.3% increase.\\n\\nThe next mile of structure must be 3.3% thicker in cro section\\nto support the top mile of tower plu the payload.  Each mile\\nof structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way\\nto the bottom.  We can see from thi that there i no theoretical\\nlimit on area, although there will be practical limit bas on how much composite we can afford to by at $40/lb, and how\\nmuch load you ne to support on the ground (for which you ne a foundation that the bedrock can support.\\n\\nLet u arbitrari choose $1 billion a the limit in costruction\\ncost.  With thi we can afford perhap 10,000,000 lb of composite \\nassum our finish structure cost $100/lb.  The $40/lb figure\\ni just for material cost.  Then we have a tower/payload ma ratio of 35.7:1.

The company hope thi single-stage rocket technology\\ndemonstrator will be the first step toward a single-stage-to-orbit (SSTO)\\nrocket ship.\\n\\n        The white conical vehicle wa schedul to go to the White Sand Missile Range in New Mexico thi week.  Flight test will start in\\nmid-June.\\n\\n        Although there wasn\\'t a cloud in the noonday sky, the forecast for\\nSSTO research remain cloudy.  The SDI Organization -- which paid $60\\nmillion for the DC-X -- can\\'t itself afford to fund full development of a\\nfollow-on vehicle.  To get the necessary hundr of million requir for\\na sub-orbital DC-XA, SDIO i pa a tin cup among it sister government\\nagencie \\n\\n        SDIO original fund SSTO research a a way to cut the cost for\\norbital deployment of space-bas sensor and weapn   However, recent\\nchange in SDI\\' political march order and budget cut have made SSTO\\nle of a priority.  Today, the agency i more interest in u DC-X a a step toward a low-cost, reusable sound rocket.\\n\\n        SDIO ha already done 50 briefing to other government agencie \\nsaid Col.  Simon \"Pete\" Worden, SDIO\\' deputy for technology.  But Worden\\ndeclin to say how much the agencie would have to pony up for the\\nprogram. \"I didn\\'t make colonel by tell my contractor how much money I\\nhave available to spend,\" he quipp at a pre conference at McDonnell\\nDougla Astronautic headquarter \\n\\n        While SDIO ha lower it sight on the program\\' orbital\\nobjective, agency official hail the DC-X a an example of the \"better,\\nfaster, cheaper\" approach to hardware development.  The agency believe thi philosophy can produce breakthrough that \"leapfrog\" ahead of\\nevolutionary technology development \\n\\n        Worden said the DC-X illustrate how a \"build a little, test a\\nlittle\" approach can produce result on time and within budget.  He said\\nthe program -- which went from concept to hardware in around 18 month --\\nshow how today\\' engineer could move beyond the \"miracle of our\\nparent  time.\"\\n\\n        \"The key i management,\" Worden said. \"SDIO had a very light hand\\non thi project.  We had on one overwork major, Je Sponable.\"\\n\\n        Although the next phase may involve more agencie  Worden said\\nlean management and a sense of government-industry partnership will be\\ncrucial. \"It\\' essential we do not end up with a large management\\nstructure where the price goe up exponential \"\\n\\n        SDIO\\' approach also won praise from two California member of the\\nHouse Science, Space and Technology Committee. \"Thi i the direction\\nwe\\'re go to have to go,\" said Rep.  George Brown, the committee\\' Democratic chairman. \"Program that stretch aout 10 to 15 year aren\\'t\\nsustainable....NASA hasn\\'t learn it yet.  SDIO ha \"\\n\\n        Rep.  Dana Rohrbacher, Brown\\' Republican colleague, went further.\\nJok that \"a shrimp i a fish design by a NASA design team,\"\\nRohrbacher doubt that the program ever would have been complet if it\\nwere left to the civil space agency.\\n\\n        Rohrbacher, whose Orange County district include McDonnell\\nDougla  also criticiz NASA-Air Force work on conventional, multi-stag rocket a plac new casing around old missile technology. \"Let\\' not\\nbuild fancy ammunition with capsule on top.  Let\\' build a spaceship!\"\\n\\n         Although Rohrbacher prais SDIO\\' sponsorship, he said the\\nprivate sector ne to take the lead in develop SSTO technology.\\n\\n        McDonnell Dougla  which face very uncertain prospect with it C-17 transport and Space Station Freedom program  were more cautiou about a large private secotro commitment. \"On very large venture \\ncompanie put in se money,\" said Charle Ordahl, McDonnell Dougla \\nsenior vice president for space system  \"You ne strong government\\ninvestment \"\\n\\n        While the government and industry continue to differ on fund for the DC-XA, they agree on continu an incremental approach to\\ndevelopment.  Cit corporate history, they liken the proce to Dougla Aircraft\\' DC aircraft.  Just a two earlier aircraft pav the way for\\nthe DC-3 transport, a gradual evolution in single-stage rocketry could\\neventual lead to an orbital Delta Clipper (DC-1).\\n\\n        Flight test thi summer at White Sand will \"expand the envelope\"\\nof performance, with successive test increa spe and altitude.  The\\nfirst test will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hover  verticle\\ntake-off and land   The second serie will send the unmann DC-X up to\\n5,000 feet.  The third and final serie will take the craft up to 20,000\\nfeet.\\n\\n        Maneuver will become more complex on third phase.  The final\\ntest will include a \"pitch-over\" manever that rotate the vehicle back\\ninto a bottom-down configuration for a soft, four-legg land \\n\\n        The flight test serie will be supervis by Charle \"Pete\"\\nConrad, who perform similar maneuver on the Apollo 12 moon land \\nNow a McDonnell Dougla vice president, Conrad pais the vehicle aircraft-like approach to operation   Feature include automat check-out and acce panel for easy maintainance.\\n\\n        If the program move to the next stage, engine technology will\\nbecome a key consideration.  Thi engine would have more thrust than the\\nPratt & Whitney RL10A-5 engine us on the DC-X.  Each motor use liquid\\nhydrogen and liquid oxygen propellant to generate up to 14,760 pound of\\nthrust\\n\\n        Bas on the engine us in Centaur upper stage  the A-5 model\\nha a thrust champer design for sea level operation and three-to-on\\nthrottl capability.  It also i design for repeat firing and rapid\\nturnaround.\\n\\n        Worden said future single-stage rocket could employ\\ntri-propellant engine technology develop in the former Soviet Union.\\nThe result engine could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and\\nthen switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitude ', u': \\n: Probab not.

For\\nprovid me thi forum I would sincere like to thank the U. \\nSpace Foundation.  My topic today i the Single Stage Rocket\\nTechnology rocket or SSRT.  By I intend to speak of more.  How to\\nlower the cost and make rapid progre   SSRT i to my mind --\\nand I hope to convince you -- the erupt a new ral cry for\\nour generation in space -- Faster, Cheaper, and Better.\\n\\n     Faster, Cheaper, Better and SSRT represent the pa of a\\ntorch from one technical generation to another.  It i a new\\nth to be sure -- but it i also a relearn of old thing from past master \\n\\n     When we roll out the SSRT baby two week ago, so call expert told u it violate the law of physic -- it made no\\nsense.  For example, Dr. Eberhart Rachtin - former president of\\nthe Aerospace Corp., said of SSRT in the L.A. Time that it,\\n\"defie the best principle of launch payload into space.\" \\nWell Dr. Rachtin -- you\\'ve made u mad!  What are these\\nprinciple that SSRT defie \\n\\n     Well I\\'ll tell you.  It violate the principle that you ne a giant program office to build space hardware.  It violate the\\n\"fact\" that it take 20 year to build someth new.  And it\\nviolate the truism that you cant do anyth significant for\\nle than many billion of dollar \\n\\n     It took some of the last generation\\' expert to teach u some new/old lesson   Werhner Von Braun\\' first rocket wa not a\\nSaturn V.  General Schriever\\' ICBM\\' didn\\'t take ten year to\\ndemonstrate.  And the X-1 airplane didn\\'t cost $1 billion.\\n\\n     It took one of the great engineer of the 1950\\' to remind\\nu of these truth -- Max Hunter.  Max, to remind you, wa a\\nsenior engineer in the Thor IRBM program, and old faster, better,\\ncheaper succe story.  Max ha been persistent in a vision of a\\nsingle stage reusable space launch system since the 1960\\'  \\nBecause he knew it had to be done in affordable step - Build a\\nlittle, Test a little.\\n\\n     Next he persuad u to do a technology demonstration.  We\\ndidn\\'t solicit a bunch of requirement -- they\\'d just change\\nevery few year anyway.  [ not includ in the speech -- The\\nAL NL ha such ephemeral requirement that it would better\\nknown a \"Shape Shifter\" than \"Space Lifter.\"  We didn\\'t spend a\\nlot money -- thi X-Rocket on cost $60 million.  When\\' the\\nlast time we even built a new airplane for that?  And it didn\\'t\\ntake a lot of time to build -- McDonnell Dougla complet it in\\n18 month   Final  the government program office consist of\\none very over-work Air Force Major -- motivat in part by the\\nthreat that he\\'d get to ride on it in a strapp on lawn chair if\\nit ran over cost or schedule.\\n\\n     A I describ what SSRT i -- and isn\\'t keep in mind it on a first step.  There are several more step -- and step that can easi fail -- before the U.  can field an SSTO.  But\\neach step should follow the same principle -- a small management\\nteam -- a few year technology demonstration -- and a modest\\nbudget.\\n\\n     Let me show a few detail on SSRT and how it might evolve:\\n(See chart \\n\\n     I\\'m embarrass when my generation i compar with the last\\ngeneration -- the giant of the last great space era, the 1950\\' and 1960\\'   They went to the moon - we built a telescope that\\ncan\\'t see straight.  They soft-land on Mar - the least we\\ncould do i soft-land on Earth!\\n\\n     But we do have an answer.  We can follow their build a\\nlittle, test a little philosophy to produce a tru affordable\\nand routine acce to space.  I know there are nay sayer among\\nyou -- those who say SSRT i a stunt.  It ne more thermal\\nprotection, the engine are wrong, it would be better to land\\nhorizontal  etc, etc.\\n\\n     I say to you -- we\\'ll see you at White Sand in June.  You\\nbr your view-graph  and I\\'ll br my rocketship.  If we do\\nwhat we say we can do, then you let u do the next step.

To try to convince you\\nall of thi particular point of view, I would probab have to do a lot\\nof work research what ha been done in thi field, etc., in order to\\ngather further evidence, which I simp do not have time to do now.  \\n\\nAlso note that I said that I think extra-marital sex i \"a prime cause\"\\n(in my opinion) of the general greater level of psychological\\nproblem  especial depression, in Western societie   I am not say it i \"the prime cause\" or \"the on cause\", just \"a prime cause\" --\\ni.e. one of the significant contribution to thi trend.  I think when\\nyou say you think my view i simplistic, you have forgotten thi -- I\\nadmit that there are probab other factor  but I do think that\\nextra-marital sex (and, IMO, subsequent destabilization of the fami \\ni a significant factor in the rise in psychological problem like\\ndepression in Western society thi century.', u\"The latest new seem to be that Koresh will give himself up once he' finish writ a sequel to the Bible.\\n\", u'\\nWasn\\'t there a \"plain\" flavor too?

    "(6) The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. That is, logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small size. The default regularization, L2, computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (see P3, above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. The result is that whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives lots of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",

    "Train a logistic regression model using a \"l1\" penalty. Output the number of learned weights that are not equal to zero. How does this compare to the number of non-zero weights you get with \"l2\"? Now, reduce the size of the vocabulary by keeping only those features that have at least one non-zero weight and retrain a model using \"l2\".\n",
